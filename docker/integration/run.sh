# sees this — but eol=lf governs what *checkout* writes, not what an editor writes afterwards, and
# on 2026-07-29 four scripts in this working tree had been rewritten to CRLF. The whole local

# the container, which is the outcome the check was written to prevent. `od` turns the byte into

These are read by Linux tooling — bind-mounted into the container, or fed to BuildKit. dash
reads `set -u<CR>` in a script and aborts with `set: Illegal option -` before any check runs;
in the mounted floor file a trailing CR makes the ratchet compare against a value that is not
a number; in a Dockerfile it survives a plain `RUN` and not a heredoc inside one. Git stores
them with LF, so something in this working tree rewrote them. Fix, from the repo root:

    sed -i 's/\r$//' <the files above>          # or: git add --renormalize . && git checkout -- .

Then re-run. Nothing was built, so this costs you nothing but the fix.
