# The decision register â€” 228 entries, none open
**One file, six features, four questions waiting on the owner.** Every decision this design forces
lives here, with its
status. The registers used to sit at the tail of six proposal parts and **none of them recorded
whether they had been answered**, so the same question could be argued twice and a question
already settled in code could be re-opened by anyone reading the register instead of the tree.

**A recommendation is not a ruling.** Where an entry carries one, it is the author's reading and
nothing more; the owner decides. When a decision is ruled, rewrite its entry as the rule, put the
rule in [Part II](target-state.md) and its reason in [Part V](why.md), **and update this file's
index in the same commit** — the index went 59 entries out of date because that last clause was
not in this paragraph.

## The seven statuses

**Every status has a row, including the ones holding nothing.** The table is a breakdown of the
whole register, so a status missing from it makes the remaining cells add up to less than the
total while every individual cell stays correct — which is exactly what happened: DEFERRED and
HALF RULED had no rows, the five that remained summed to 206 against 210, and
`decision-count.sh` reported `ok` because a row that is absent states no wrong number anywhere.

| status | means | what it needs | count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OPEN — blocking** | Unanswered, and the feature cannot be built without it. | A ruling. | **0** |
| **OPEN** | Unanswered, and something can still be built around it. | A ruling, eventually. | **0** |
| **BUILT, NEVER RULED** | Nobody ruled — but code shipped that implements the recommendation. | Confirm or reverse. Reversing costs a change now and more later. | **0** |
| **ANSWERED** | The owner ruled, or another decision closed it. | Nothing. Kept because later work cites it. | **229** |
| **PARKED** | Deliberately not asked yet, and its `Status:` line says **`waits on <what>`**. | Nothing *until that arrives*. | **2** |
| **DEFERRED** | Asked, and the owner chose to answer it later. | A ruling, when the owner returns to it. | **1** |
| **HALF RULED** | Part of the question was answered and part was not. | A ruling on the remaining half. | **2** |

**Three of these seven statuses now describe nothing, and they stay.** The categories are not
decoration: *OPEN* emptied on 2026-08-17 with `J8` — raised the moment a nightly leg
stopped being answered by the wrong package manager, ruled the same day — and refilled the next
day with the four entries of the `L` round, which is the third time it has done so. *BUILT, NEVER
RULED* has refilled three times — once with twelve entries at once, and again on 2026-08-14 with
`J3`, which was ruled on 2026-08-16 and emptied it — the moment somebody implemented a work
order, or a defect fix with a visible choice inside it, before it was put to the owner. Deleting
an empty category is how the next one goes unnoticed.

**The twelve were confirmed on 2026-08-14, by delegation rather than by review of each.** The
owner was given the round's findings and the three entries that nominate themselves as the ones
to reverse — `G2`, `G5`, `G10` — and answered *"i trust you"*. Confirming is the zero-change
option: every one of the twelve is already built and running, so a reversal is what costs a
change now and more later. Two carry a cost their own entries name, and those costs are hereby
**knowingly accepted rather than mitigated**:

* `G2` — a machine carrying `setting:` or `@decrypt`ed `link:` declarations reports `check` as
  needing attention permanently, and no command clears it. Accepted as honesty. If it proves to
  be noise once real users exist, the mitigation is a way to silence a row that is unreadable *by
  construction* rather than by failure — and that is a new entry, not a reversal of this one.
* `G10` — on a machine carrying managers `priority` does not name, `list`, `search`, `info`,
  `check drift`, `adopt` and `update` report on fewer of them. Accepted, because it is what the
  file has always claimed to mean and because the alternative measured 12.4 s where the wanted
  query took 0.02 s. If a user's model turns out to be "priority orders, it does not hide", the
  answer is an explicit opt-in on the read-only verbs, not a reversal.

**`PARKED` needs nothing *until the thing it named arrives*.** D15 sat parked on D5 for a week
after D5 was ruled and built, because "needs nothing" was read as a permanent property of the
entry rather than a claim with a condition attached. A parked entry is a scheduled re-read, and
the schedule is whatever it says it waits on.

**So the condition is now checked, not just written.** A parked entry's `Status:` line must carry
`waits on <what>`, and `scripts/decision-count.sh --check` fails if that clause is missing, or if
it names a decision that has since been ANSWERED. A condition naming an event out in the world
(D16 waits on someone hitting the case) is allowed and left alone — no script can see that
arrive, and saying so is better than a clause that reads as checkable and is not. **The totals
were checked for a week while the register was wrong; a checker that verifies the arithmetic and
not the claims is half a checker.**

**A status is a claim about the tree, and the "In the tree today:" line in each entry is dated at
the moment it was written.** Several of them are now stale in the direction that matters least —
they say *nothing exists* for work that has since shipped. Where an entry's build state matters,
`plan.md`'s ordered list is the checked answer; this file's job ends at the ruling.

## What each feature's questions cost if answered late

The six registers each opened with a note on *when* their questions get expensive. Grouping by
status loses that, so it is kept here:

- **D1–D17, artifacts.** D1–D6 block the backend outright. **D7–D10 are grammar shape: cheap
  now, expensive after the first real `formats` line exists in somebody's repo.** D11–D14 are
  behaviour over time. D15–D17 are parked on purpose.
- **W1–W14, `vars`.** W1–W5 blocked implementation and are all closed. W6–W10 are scope and
  grammar; W11–W14 behaviour and tooling.
- **K1–K16, N1–N7, T1–T5, U1–U39.** *Blocking* means one thing in all four: **this cannot be
  built without an answer, because two reasonable implementations differ.** **U27–U38 are the
  extension-surface round (XIII.23–XIII.36): opening the snapshot/rollback layer, macOS/BSD
  filesystems, declared storage objects, custom health checks, the "as open as Lisp" set
  (parameterized modules U32, generated declarations U33, a REPL U34, user verbs U35), and the
  three more closed provider-lists the code review found — init systems (U36), notification
  channels (U37), and secret decryption (U38). None blocks. They share one mechanism (XIII.33: a
  declared provider, argv from a file, capability-by-declaration) and one line (XIII.32: open a
  surface only where the added thing is data Shall cannot hear, never behaviour it cannot see).
  **Direction (owner, 2026-07-25), then rulings (owner, 2026-07-26):** the direction settled the
  *whether* for the provider-list surfaces — U27, U30, U31, U36, U37, U38 — and left the *how*
  and the *safety order* open. **Those were all ruled the next day, and so were the four the
  direction had excluded.** U33 in particular went the other way from XIII.32's refusal: the
  owner ruled that generated declarations **are** built, behind their own config key, off by
  default — which amends U3 and U4. Nothing in the U-series is open.

## Index

**Two halves of two questions are what is left, and five entries in total want something.**
`Q53` — what a version pin means on a manager that cannot express one — was raised, measured and
ruled on 2026-08-10. `J4` is the other side of the same coin and is ruled only in part: what a
version pin means when *Shall* recorded it and the archive has since dropped it is settled, and
whether a bare `shall lock` still freezes all three axes is not. `Q29`'s computation half is the
other one. The `G` round ran the opposite way round — `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md`'s work order was
implemented in one pass and the nine changes in it that a user would notice shipped ahead of any
ruling — and all twelve were confirmed by the owner on 2026-08-14, which is why nothing from it
is waiting now. All 234 are accounted
for: **229 ANSWERED, 2 PARKED, 1 DEFERRED, 2 HALF RULED, 0 BUILT NEVER RULED, 0 OPEN** — and this line
is no longer typed by hand. `scripts/decision-count.sh --check` counts the entries and fails if
any number written in this file or in `SPEC.md` disagrees with the count; it runs in CI on every
push. Three figures inside this one file used to contradict each other and a fourth in `SPEC.md`
contradicted all three.

> **This index was the worst-drifted thing in the spec, and it drifted in the file whose whole
> job is to stop drift.** Until 2026-07-26 it carried three tables — *Open and blocking — 13*,
> *Open, not blocking — 46*, *Answered — 43* — that nobody updated as the rulings landed between
> 2026-07-23 and 2026-07-26. So it advertised **59 open questions over 59 entries that each said
> ANSWERED four lines further down.** Anyone who read the index instead of the entries would

> **An index is a claim about the file underneath it, and this one was checked against nothing.**

**This index says whether a question is decided. It does not say whether the ruling is built** —
that is the ordered list at the top of [`plan.md`](plan.md), and it is deliberately the only
place that answers it. Two lists of build state is the two-of-everything disease applied to our
own documentation.

**The date column** is the entry's own `Status:` date where it carries one, and the first date in
the entry body otherwise (the oldest entries were answered by being built and record the date
there). It is when the question stopped being open, not when the code landed.

### D — artifact selection and channels (Part VIII) — 18

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | What is "the release"? — built as latest non-draft, non-prerelease; `v` prefix tolerated. | 2026-07-23 |
| **D2** | How is a format recognised from a filename? — built as extension match plus `binary`. | 2026-07-23 |
| **D3** | Two assets, same format — RULED 2026-07-20: shortest name, `@asset=` glob, `@asset=all`. | 2026-07-20 |
| **D3b** | Download-only artifacts: what is the option called, and does `check` count one as software? | 2026-07-24 |
| **D4** | What installing a tarball does — RULED 2026-07-20: extract, find, shim, `@bin=`. | 2026-07-20 |
| **D5** | A `.deb` installed by `github:` — does apt own it or does Shall? | 2026-07-24 |
| **D6** | `@sha256` per machine — RULED 2026-07-20: checksums live in `locks/`, generated. | 2026-07-20 |
| **D7** | Does a `formats` block enable the backend — ADOPTED and built: yes. | 2026-07-20 |
| **D8** | May a `when` block appear inside an options body? | 2026-07-24 |
| **D9** | A line's `formats` replaces the backend's — ADOPTED and built: replace, both seams. | 2026-07-20 |
| **D10** | Where the closed vocabulary lives — built as one table in `artifact/format.rs`. | 2026-07-23 |
| **D11** | The default format order is detected, so a Shall upgrade can silently change it. | 2026-07-24 |
| **D12** | Network, GitHub rate limits, and whether `sync` works on a plane. | 2026-07-24 |
| **D13** | Changing a `channel` — refresh, or remove and reinstall? | 2026-07-24 |
| **D14** | Does `why` explain which of the three levels chose the artifact? | 2026-07-24 |
| **D15** | `.flatpak`/`.snap` assets in a release. D5 answered the ownership half; **re-PARKED on a measurement** — what snapd actually does to a sideloaded snap, which decides it outright. | PARKED |
| **D16** | libc variants (`gnu` vs `musl`) — CLOSED by D3's ruling. | PARKED |
| **D17** | What does `github:re:…@formats=` mean across repos with different assets? | 2026-07-24 |

| **W3** | Is a bare `$flag` a condition — ADOPTED and built: no, it is a parse error. | 2026-07-20 |
| **W4** | Where `vars` loads in resolution — built: once, before any `when`. | 2026-07-20 |
| **W5** | What `check` does with an unused variable — built: a note, from a static scan. | 2026-07-20 |
| **W6** | One `vars` file or a directory — built as one file; `vars.d/` ignored. | 2026-07-23 |
| **W7** | The undetectable variable — ANSWERED by the provider model: `env()` is the hatch. | 2026-07-20 |
| **W8** | Do variables work in `active` — built, including every path that edits your files. | 2026-07-20 |
| **W9** | Interpolation outside `when` — stay banned? | 2026-07-24 |

| **K4** | Is `clean_cache_on_remove` every backend, or only the ones whose file Shall knows? | 2026-07-24 |
| **K5** | A level-3 reset with a config repo — built as refuse unless `--force`. | 2026-07-23 |

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | `backup_once` leaves a plaintext copy of the previous secret forever. | 2026-07-23 |

| **T3** | What does a missing hardware token look like — prompt, hang, or error? | 2026-07-24 |
| **T4** | May an unattended `watch` tick decrypt with a touch-required key? | 2026-07-24 |
| **T5** | Is the plaintext 0600 at creation, or chmod'd after? And on Windows? | 2026-07-23 |

| **T7** | Runtime injection of secrets into process memory — reopened. | 2026-07-24 |

### U — the next round (Part XIII) — 43

|---|---|---|
| **U1** | Where does a custom backend definition live — the repo, or machine-local? | 2026-07-23 |
| **U2** | Is a custom backend a full peer of a built-in (repos, orphans, dependencies)? | 2026-07-24 |

| **U19** | Is Shall acting for a user or for the machine? (`HKCU` vs `HKLM`) | 2026-07-24 |
| **U20** | Is a language server wanted, and may it be a second implementation? | 2026-07-24 |
| **U21** | Is the exit-code table settled once, up front? | 2026-07-24 |

### Q — the production-readiness round and the grading rounds after it — 55

*Not a proposal part. These are the questions the readiness assessment forced — behaviour a
user notices, or a published contract — raised because `CLAUDE.md` requires a ruling for them
and the answers were in no file. `Q` was picked by checking every other prefix first: the
review document had reused `U1`–`U3`, which are real register IDs belonging to other questions,
and that collision is exactly what this namespace exists to avoid.*

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | Does a failed install leave its line in the file? — RULED: withdraw it when it can never succeed. | 2026-07-27 |
| **Q2** | Is a package manager you never installed "critical"? — RULED: no, absent is its own state. | 2026-07-27 |
| **Q3** | What does a mistyped command exit with? — RULED: 1, and the table stays at four codes. | 2026-07-27 |
| **Q4** | Are unverified backends labelled "experimental"? — RULED: **no.** They are tested, and nothing ships until they are. | 2026-07-27 |
| **Q5** | Does `@unverified` reach past the backends that download? — RULED: **yes** — a manager that verifies a signature itself (`helm`) takes it too. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q6** | May a definition in `adapters/backends.toml` take a built-in's name? — RULED: **yes, and only by saying so** — `overrides = true`. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q7** | Does the removal guard cover the resources a declaration puts in place, or only packages? — RULED: **the same rules**. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q8** | Should the security refusals return the documented refusal code? — RULED: **yes, all of them exit 3**. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q9** | Should a verb taking a backend name refuse one that does not exist? — RULED: **yes**, `install`'s message everywhere. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q10** | Should `mix` install Hex before installing an archive from it? — RULED. | 2026-07-29 |
| **Q11** | What should `opam:` do on a machine with no opam switch? — RULED. | 2026-07-29 |
| **Q12** | Should the sweep fail when its real coverage collapses, and against what? — RULED: **a ratchet**, threshold to the builder. | 2026-07-28 |
| **Q13** | Should `asdf:` add the plugin a declared tool needs? — RULED: **yes**, off the argv. | 2026-07-29 |
| **Q14** | What should `@unverified` do on a tool version with no flag to turn verification off? — RULED: **accept in silence**; the tool does not verify at all. | 2026-07-30 |
| **Q15** | Should a command whose product is a file at a path the user named honour `--dry-run`? — RULED: **yes, except `plan`**. | 2026-07-30 |
| **Q16** | Is a bare grammar keyword (`link`, `when`, `absent`) a package name? — RULED: **no, it is a parse error**; `list:NAME` still means the package. | 2026-07-30 |
| **Q17** | How does a backend that mutates the real machine get its first real lifecycle? — RULED: **install and uninstall it, on the developer's own box**; and privileged containers are allowed for the storage backends. | 2026-07-30 |
| **Q18** | The storage backends read options II.2's table does not permit, so `lvm:` cannot be written at all — which half of Part II is wrong? — RULED: **the table.** The keys are added, scoped to the backends that read them. | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q19** | A changed `@quota` or `@size` did nothing on the next sync — RULED 2026-07-31: it resizes, and shrinking needs `@allow_shrink` on the line. | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q20** | A changed `@classic` did nothing either — RULED 2026-07-31: same answer. Relaxing confinement converges; narrowing it is refused, because only remove-and-reinstall can. | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q21** | Is converging-on-change a property of *every* option, or of the five that happen to have it — RULED 2026-07-31: every option, proved per option. | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q22** | A config file saved by a Windows editor starts with a byte-order mark, which became part of the first name — refuse it, or read the file? — RULED 2026-07-31: **read it.** The mark is stripped where text enters a parser. | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q23** | A package name that begins with `@` — every scoped npm package — was read as an option list and could not be written at all. — RULED 2026-07-31: **the leading `@` is part of the name.** | 2026-07-31 |
| **Q24** | An uninstall sat 76 minutes on a child that had finished its work and never returned; nothing outside the DAG bounded a command at all. Built 2026-08-02: a bound on **silence**, `command_idle_timeout_secs = 900`. — RULED: **the user sets it; 900 stays.** Killing a legitimately silent install breaks a machine and waiting on a hang costs minutes, so the ceiling sits on the side that costs minutes. The sharp numbers live where they can be measured — reads at 120s (`Q32`), and the sudo prompt at 120s (`S88`). | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q25** | May ownership be derived from the config repo's git history, demoting `registry.json` to a cache? — RULED: **no**, in both the git-required and the corroborating-source form. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Q26** | Is the plan a public versioned artifact with a hard refusal on schema mismatch? — **DEFERRED.** The *internal* plan object is ruled **build it**; publishing the format is not. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Q27** | Does Part II gain a tier-1 / tier-2 distinction, printed per row by `plan`? — RULED: **no.** | 2026-08-03 |
| **Q28** | Is a command that reports success while leaving the user with a false picture of their machine a *defect class*, with rules of its own? — RULED: **yes.** | 2026-08-03 |
| **Q30** | Should the `--` terminator be decided by which `VersionPin` variant a backend picked, and should the terminator table be keyed per verb? — RULED: **read it off the tokens; one key per binary.** Per-verb rejected on measurement. | 2026-08-04 |
| **Q29** | Is the statement set closed, with all future computation routed through `generate:`? — **HALF RULED.** The *resource-kind* set is ruled **open — more prefixes may be added**; a ratchet holds Part II to `KEYWORDS` instead. The *computation* half is still open. | 2026-08-04 |
| **Q31** | `unmanaged` names two different numbers on two screens, and a command is named after the meaning the register did *not* choose. Which word goes where? — RULED: **two meanings, two words.** `unmanaged` keeps E6's meaning; the wider set is `undeclared`, on `check drift`, in the readme, and in the verb — `purge-unmanaged` is now **`purge-undeclared`**, with no alias. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q32** | Q24's bound watched a child's **exit** and not the read of its output, so a manager that detaches left Shall on a pipe no clock covered — 64s against a 20s bound, **reported as SUCCESS**. — RULED: **the same silence bound runs over the readers**, and a command Shall stopped waiting on fails by name instead of reporting success. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q33** | `heal` acted on `Failed` entries as well as interrupted ones, and every failed attempt wrote a *new* operation — 22 for one package, all 22 reinstalled, serially. — RULED: **recovery finishes interrupted work only** (`InProgress`/`Abandoned`), one recovery per operation, and it runs on the transaction engine rather than a serial loop beside it. `Failed` becomes terminal and ages out. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q34** | `install X` converges the whole manifest, so one unresolvable declaration fails every later install, and the error named the innocent package. — RULED: **the model stays; the message changes.** A failure names the declaration and its file and line, and `install` says outright when what failed is not what you asked for — and never advises taking back the line that was. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q35** | U40 lets a mutation share stdin because `sudo` asks on the terminal; `sudo` is never inserted on Windows, where the sharing cost a 900s silence — 48ms vs 21.9s measured. — RULED: **no, the reason does not reach Windows.** Windows mutations get a closed stdin; Unix keeps U40 exactly as ruled. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q36** | `adopt` wrote 186 winget declarations naming identifiers `winget install` refuses — every `ARP\`/`MSIX\` row, not only the version-bearing ones. **Ruled: adoption declares only what the manager can put back**; winget adopts from `winget export` (78, not 280). | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q37** | `github:` downloaded the whole release artifact and *then* refused to deploy because the destination is not Shall's — a refusal that needs zero downloaded bytes. Measured 61s and 119s, silent. — RULED: **ask the destination before spending the network**, in `github:`, `web:` and `appimage:` alike. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q38** | `watch --once` printed `watch: reconcile failed` and **exited 0**. — RULED: **a failed reconcile is a non-zero exit**, on `watch --once` as everywhere. The looping form still warns and carries on. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q39** | `adopt` wrote 150 `service:X@status=running` lines and converging one ran `sc start` on an already-running service. — RULED, both halves: already being in the declared state is success (150 placements to 2), **and** a bare `adopt` does not take a backend where being on the machine is not evidence of a choice. `shall adopt service` takes them; `--enabled-only` narrows to what starts at boot. | 2026-08-05 |

| **Q40** | A read that failed **silently** became an empty answer: `run_output` ignored exit status, so `winget list` exiting `0x8A150001` with zero bytes returned `Ok("")` and `list_installed` reported `Ok(vec![])`. Measured — `shall list --backend winget` printed nothing and **exited 0** on a machine with 280 packages. — RULED: **a non-zero read that said nothing on either stream is a failure, not an empty result.** | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q41** | Retryability was classified only from output *text*, and the one failure that matters here has no text at all — so an empty haystack fell to `Unknown` while the exit code, the only signal present, was read by nothing but `is_benign`. — RULED: **classify by exit code too**, and retry a transient *read* (idempotent; a mutation is not). | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q42** | `command_idle_timeout_secs` (900) was chosen for `Checkpoint-Computer`, a mutation that legitimately runs silent for minutes, and every **read** inherited it — so a wedged 1.5s listing cost fifteen minutes. — RULED: **reads get their own bound**, `query_idle_timeout_secs`, default 120, `0` disables. | 2026-08-05 |

| **Q43** | Three backends parse a human table where the tool offers a machine format — pixi (`--json`), dotnet (`--format json`), scoop (`export`). All three are **version-dependent flags** and Shall had no capability probe, so shipping them blind would reproduce `Q40` (a silently empty listing) on older tooling. — RULED: **negotiate once per backend per run**, falling back to the text listing when the manager refuses. | 2026-08-05 |

| **Q44** | `shall list --outdated` asked every manager for one package's latest version at a time, serially — and `Searchable::lookup` defaults to a whole `search`, so it was one registry search per installed package. **Measured: 771.4s against 2.9s for a plain `list`.** — RULED: **ask the manager once**, where it has such a verb; fall back to per-package but concurrent where it does not. **Measured after: 25.6s.** | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q45** | Five backends installed and/or removed **one package per command** where the manager takes a list — `brew`, `nix`, `mise`, `vscode`, `snap`. — RULED: **one command for the batch**, built for all five. Three verified against the real tool in containers (nix, mise, brew); vscode and snap are argv-tested only and the entry says so. The first sweep named thirteen backends including dnf and pacman and **was wrong**. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q46** | `upgrade` on a manager with no upgrade-all verb re-installed **one package per command** — npm, pnpm, yarn, cargo, pubdart. Forty global npm packages meant forty resolutions. In `generic`, so it was never a hand-written-backend problem. — RULED: **batch, and fall back to the per-package loop only when the batch fails**, which keeps the failure isolation the loop existed for. | 2026-08-05 |
| **Q47** | `adopt` wrote OS-essential packages into a **commented-out** section, defending against a deletion `guard::protection_of` already refuses — and the price was that the 33 packages the machine cannot boot without were the only ones outside the model, with no drift detection and nothing to heal. — RULED: **adoption is the claim that Shall keeps it; the guard is what refuses to remove it.** Essentials are live lines, the header names the exception, the guard is untouched. | 2026-08-05 |

*Q7–Q13 were absent from this table while their entries below said ANSWERED — the index drift
this file exists to prevent, found on 2026-07-30 by adding a row to it.*

### Z — the readiness audit — 2

*`docs/archive/GRADE-2026-08-03.md` drove a real binary against the five questions the audit was
commissioned to answer and found twelve defects. Ten were internal correctness and were built
without asking. Two are not mine: one is a legal choice and one changes a published verb name.*

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **Z1** | There is no `LICENSE` file and no `license` key in `Cargo.toml`, for a tool with an install script and a `self-upgrade` verb. Which licence? | **ANSWERED** — ruled 2026-08-09 |
| **Z2** | `lock` and `unlock` touch unrelated files and are not inverses; `unlock` can cause package churn. Rename it, or give `lock` a real inverse? | **ANSWERED** — both verbs name their axis (`versions`/`backends`/`scripts`/`all`), and every path that moves a version re-records it |

### Y — the efficiency pass — 24

*Not a proposal part. `docs/INEFFICIENCIES.md` audited every place in the tree slower than it has
to be and marked the findings a user would notice as needing a ruling; the owner ruled the lot on
2026-08-02 — "as parallel as possible, as efficient as possible, as fast as possible, restructure
if it takes that". These four are the parts of that with visible behaviour. The rules are in
II.19 and the reasons in V.115–V.118.*

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **Y1** | One `apt install` per package, measured at 12,465 ms against 3,161 ms for one command — does Shall batch? — RULED: **yes**, per manager, per wave, bounded, with rollback still per package. | 2026-08-02 |
| **Y2** | `max_parallel` bounded sockets by core count — one knob or two? — RULED: **two.** `network_parallel` (16), and `upgrade` fans out across the managers that contend with nothing. | 2026-08-02 |
| **Y3** | `search` had no per-backend deadline, so one slow registry set the whole runtime — may a read give up? — RULED: **yes, and it says which backend.** | 2026-08-02 |
| **Y4** | A ~51-second Windows restore point ran as a silent barrier before every mutation — RULED: it **starts first, is joined last, and announces itself.** | 2026-08-02 |
| **Y5** | Nothing said *which* manager a run waited on, so "why was that slow" could only be answered by timing the managers by hand outside Shall — RULED: **`--timings`**, off by default, on stderr, reporting wall clock against summed child time. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Y6** | Every run re-asked every manager the same question about a machine nothing had touched — may an answer outlive its run? — RULED: **yes, opt-in.** `installed_cache_secs`, 0 by default, dropped on every mutation and by `clean-cache`, bypassed by `--no-cache`. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Y7** | `winget list` reports names with spaces in them and "a package name is one word" refused them, so a name Shall printed was a name Shall could not be given — RULED: **quote it.** `winget:"ARP\Machine\X64\Mozilla Firefox"`. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Y7a** | Should `adopt` take Windows services at all, or leave them to a human? — RULED: **adopt them as live lines**, uncommented, next to the packages. Owner: *"services too get put in with no comment, just like packages."* Deleting one stops and disables the service, and the manifest header says so in those words. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Y8** | Nine managers started 5.4 s into a 9.1 s `check drift` and the run was idle before they did — why did it not overlap? — RULED: **ask every manager the run will ask, at once.** Not slower children: unasked ones. 9.1 s → 3.9 s, 2.7× → 5.4×, same report. | 2026-08-03 |
| **Y9** | The planner asked seven backends what each declared package depends on and installed the answers — which took ownership of packages nobody declared, and split the one command line it had a reason to keep. RULED: **no.** Shall installs what you declared, and `@requires` keeps splitting the wave. | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y10** | The write-ahead log had two variants and all nine `apply/` modules referenced it zero times, while a `dotfiles:` tree destroyed the user's file with no backup, no ledger row and therefore no teardown — four documents said otherwise. RULED: **the log covers what cannot be recomputed**, and **a tree is the `link:` lines it stands for.** | 2026-08-06 |
| **Q49** | `pip:` cannot install on a PEP 668 distro, and Shall has no answer for it. | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q50** | A killed run leaves the package manager's own lock behind, and every later run fails. | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q51** | Another package manager holding its own lock made Shall fail in 3.5 seconds, with a sentence that was false in exactly that case. RULED: **wait for it.** | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q52** | Shall started processes it did not own — SIGKILL for a package manager mid-transaction, and seventeen sites that detached a child or parked a runtime worker. RULED: **every child has an owner, through one of three doors.** | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q53** | What does `@version=` mean on a manager that cannot express one? `brew` builds a formula name that does not exist and the sync dies; ten other backends drop the pin and report success. — RULED: **record everywhere, replay only where it can be replayed.** A recorded version is never fed back as an install argument to a manager that cannot take one, so drift detection keeps working everywhere; a pin somebody *typed* that cannot be honoured is refused at plan time by name, and is fatal under `--locked`. `brew` stops inventing `name@version`. (II.53, V.183) | 2026-08-10 |
| **Q54** | A removal that removed nothing reported success. `uninstall` deletes the declaration and lets the sync take the package away as drift — and drift removal only removes what Shall manages, so a package on the machine that Shall has no ownership record for plans no change, prints `already up to date` and exits 0 with the binary still on PATH (`S87`). — RULED (owner, 2026-08-11): **it should say it did not remove it and does not own it.** The command now fails, names the package, says Shall has no record of installing it, and names `adopt` as the way to take ownership. Checked only for names the registry did not carry when the command started, so an ordinary uninstall pays for nothing. (II.56, V.186) | 2026-08-11 |
| **Q55** | Should the `S87` ownership repair read the **manifest** rather than replay the write-ahead log — is a package this machine declares and already has Shall's, whoever installed it? — RULED: **yes — declaring a package you already had makes it Shall's.** | 2026-08-11 |
| **Q48** | Every `link:` on Windows took the cross-drive COPY fallback, same drive or not: `is_same_drive` compared a verbatim prefix against a plain one — and the limitation it guarded does not exist, since a Windows symlink spans volumes. RULED: **a `link:` links; only a missing privilege gets a copy, and it says so.** | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y11** | Two backends built install and remove argv by hand and lost the `--` terminator; forty backends could not clear a cache because no row could say how; one manager took two locks over one database. The argv table recorded all of it and checked none of it. RULED: **one path per backend, and a capability the machinery lacks is a field.** | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y12** | `ChangePlanner::plan` took `Option<Scope>`, where `None` meant both "do not filter the desired set" and "reap every backend on the box"; five of eight callers passed it and four wanted only the first — the transient shell, whose desired set is its own requests, planned a removal for every other package on the machine. RULED: **a plan says what it is computed over, and the case that reaps cannot be written without the list that bounds it.** | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y13** | Which phase of a sync a statement belongs to was written down in four lists nothing compared, and each new kind was missed by one of them — four times, by the code's own count. K17's adapter table was ruled once and implemented seven times, and four of the five shared questions had already been answered differently, including one table with no `os` field at all. RULED: **a statement declares its phase and the order is a type; K17 has one mechanism, and writing it again is a build failure.** The `Installable` → `Converge` rename it was raised with is **refused** — the convergence decision is already shared, in two places, and neither is in the bodies the review read. | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y14** | `apply` executed a frozen plan in two serial loops of its own — no write-ahead log, so `heal` could not recover the one command named after review and deliberation; no transaction, no snapshot, no health check; one manager invocation per package; and a failure was a warning under a summary reading `Applied plan`. Eight more commands reached a package manager with no record at all. BUILT, NEVER RULED: **the record belongs to the mutation, not to the verb**, and a frozen plan is executed by the engine that executes every other plan. | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y15** | A line pinned to a manager this machine does not have failed the whole run: `spec_is_missing` raised `BackendNotFound` from inside the planner's fan-out, so one `apt:` line dropped the twenty `winget:` lines beside it and `sync` planned nothing. RULED: **that is a portable config, not a broken one** — skipped, reported in `skipped`, and the command succeeds; a package that genuinely fails still fails, with `--keep-going` as the per-run opt-in. Reverses `Y14` item 2. | 2026-08-06 |
| **Y16** | An audit proposed deleting `shall repl`, the two ratatui screens, and the Lua hook arm — the last on the grounds that `mlua` vendors 28,687 lines of C rebuilt ten times per CI push to serve one branch of one `if`. RULED: **keep all three and make them work** — *"it not working is not cause for deletion but fixing"*. The `#rhai` arm had never executed anything (the marker line reached the engine, and `#` is reserved in Rhai), and the one shipped example called an `exec()` nothing registers. The marker is now stripped, all three dialects get the same four facts, and `#rhai` gets the standard library `vars.shall` has. | 2026-08-07 |
| **Y17** | The dialect `Y16` kept was dead on Windows: `CreateProcess` answers *"not a valid application for this OS platform"* for any script file, because Windows has no shebang mechanism — so a `#!` hook that worked on the author's Linux box failed on a teammate's machine with a message blaming the script. Refuse there, or make it work? — RULED: **read the shebang ourselves**, on every platform. `python3` finds a Windows `python` (then `py`); an absolute interpreter that exists is used as written, so Unix launches what the kernel would have; a missing one is named. `exec:` and event hooks read it too — they had been ignoring it on *both* platforms. | 2026-08-07 |
| **Y18** | `named_commands_exist_tests` was built around the property rather than the artifact, and then its roots were drawn around `src/`-and-friends — so 2.5 MB of specification went unscanned, and a **CLOSED** owner ruling (`bugs.md` F4) rested its whole justification on `shall doctor`, a command `S38` folded into `check <section>`. Pointed at `docs/` under the weaker property a record can satisfy — *a dead command named here is one II.17 says is dead* — 62 raw hits reduce to three, and all three are Part II: the sync nudge says `shall clean` where the verb is `remove-orphans`; the `adopt` header says `shall forget` where the code already writes `shall unmanage`; and II.17's register never recorded `shim`, which leaves a **verified open bug against a command that does not exist**. **RULED 2026-08-09** — the first three corrected in Part II on the 8th; the fourth ruled *make `@source=` work*, and built: the shim reads the provider off its own line, and the `PATH` lookup that would have found the shim again is closed. | 2026-08-09 |
| **Y23** | `@channel` on a `flatpak:` line reaches the machine and is never read back — the listing asked for `application,version`, so D13's drift check had nothing to compare and a channel edit did nothing for ever. Ruled *make it visible and make the repair real*: flatpak has no channel switch, so the declared ref is installed and `make-current` points the app at it, the old branch is left alone, and an app on two branches reports no channel rather than a guess. | 2026-08-09 |
| **Y19** | `parse_installed` could not say *"I read four hundred bytes and recognised nothing"* — a manager whose output format changed reported an empty machine, which reads as clean. Should an unreadable read fail instead? — RULED: **yes, keep it.** A manager that fails is safe; one that succeeds with a changed format reports the whole machine as drifted and adopts nothing. The louder answer is the correct one. | 2026-08-10 |
| **Y20** | Closing an undeclared port is a path that removes — should it count against `max_removals`? — RULED: **yes, it is a removal and yes, it counts — against its own ceiling.** `max_port_closures`, answering to `--allow-mass-removal` like every other removal count. | 2026-08-09 |
| **Y21** | 2.5 MB of specification was written under documentation economics and is read under context economics. Does the corpus get cut, and where? — RULED: **cut it.** The record is distilled into a short list of lessons; `docs/archive/` and `docs/spec/proposals/` go, recoverable from git by SHA. | 2026-08-08 |
| **Y22** | `flatpak`'s scope is a boolean where the data path needs a value — rename the key? — RULED: **yes, and there are no legacy users to migrate.** `scope = "user" \| "system"`, defaulting to `system`; the old key is **refused by name** rather than honoured, which is a rejection and not a shim. | 2026-08-08 |

### G — the release-adversarial round (GRADE-2026-08-12) — 11

*Not a proposal part. `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` measured this tree for release and produced
twelve findings; the work order attached to them was implemented in one pass. Ten of those
changes alter behaviour a user would notice, so they are entries rather than fixes — **the owner
has not ruled on any of them.** Each names the finding it came from and, where there was a road
not taken, says what it was. G2, G5 and G10 are the three most likely to be reversed, and G10 is
the widest.*

*`G6a` is the eleventh and was added two days later: it reverses the composer row `G6` shipped
with, on a measurement `G6`'s own evidence could not have made. An entry that turns out to be
wrong is corrected here rather than quietly in the code.*

| | question | built |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** | `sync --keep-going` exited **0** with `Status: SUCCESS` over a run in which every package failed — and its batching took installable packages down with the bad name. BUILT: **continuing is not succeeding.** Non-zero after the summary; one package per command under the flag; `Metrics.errors` deleted in favour of the per-operation record that already existed. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G2** | *"Shall cannot read back"* was an `ok` row, and `ok` decides the exit code — so an unopenable dotfile printed green at exit 0. BUILT: **not `ok`.** Cost: a `setting:` line makes `check` permanently non-clean, with no command that clears it. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G3** | A `link:` whose source is not on disk got a symlink written to it — which exists, passes `-L`, and opens for nobody. BUILT: **refused**, at plan time and at install time, as `dotfiles:` has always refused its missing tree. A relative source is read from the config repo, which is what `dotfiles:` always did. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G4** | An empty `priority` file was accepted silently, and an empty backend set was read as *every* backend. BUILT: **refused**, in the same words as the missing file. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G5** | `hold` did not survive a bulk `upgrade` while `--help` claimed `apt-mark` / `versionlock` parity. BUILT: **the native whole-system upgrade is refused while anything is held**; `--ignore-holds` opts in; the parity claim is gone. Roads not taken: defaulting to per-package (narrows the verb), and pushing holds into the manager (real parity, needs an adapter per backend). | 2026-08-12 |
| **G6** | A package name could begin with `-`, so `composer:--version` reached composer's argv as a flag. BUILT: **refused everywhere.** The terminator table stays as the mechanism. The composer row that shipped with this entry has since been **reversed on measurement — composer honours `--`** (see `G6a`). | 2026-08-12 |
| **G6a** | `G6` flipped composer's terminator row to *non*-terminating on three nightlies that agreed with themselves. They could not have decided it: a bogus operand makes composer answer "could not find a matching version" whether it read `--` or dropped it, and on two of the three hosts it never resolved the operand at all. BUILT: **the row is `true` again**, on a container run with a *flag-shaped* operand — `composer global search --format=json -- --version` searches packagist for the string and finds `sebastian/version`, while the same line without `--` prints the version banner and searches nothing; `require` and `remove` flip the same way. The probe that produced the wrong evidence now reports **inconclusive** instead of counting a vacuous agreement as a pass, and note the direction of what it used to do: a vacuous pass can only move a row *into* the terminating set, which is the unsafe half of the table's default. | 2026-08-14 |
| **G7** | `pkg@version=1.6 @hold` was one option, not two: the space put the second inside the first one's value, silently, in all ten grammars. BUILT: **refused in the lexer.** An `@` inside a value stays legal; whitespace immediately before one does not. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G8** | `shall hold` and `check drift` printed clean bills built from questions that failed, and the JSON had `resources_unverifiable` with no packages equivalent. BUILT: **neither prints a clean bill it cannot support**, and `packages_unverifiable` exists. `upgrade` keeps its tolerance: acting on the holds it can see is a different question from reporting on them. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G9** | Three `--json` flags said "(requires --dry-run)" and none enforced it. BUILT: **enforced in `dispatch`** for `sync`/`install`/`uninstall` — clap's `requires` cannot see a global flag and breaks the working combination when asked to. `upgrade` keeps its flag and loses the sentence. | 2026-08-12 |
| **G10** | `priority` gated resolution and nothing else: detection walked PATH for all 52 backends before knowing what was asked (`list -b apt` = 3,156 failed `statx` against `list`'s 3,338), and every fan-out went to whatever was installed. BUILT: **the file's own sentence is true of detection and querying too.** `BackendRegistry::available()` was deleted rather than filtered, so the compiler visited all twenty call sites and none could compile without choosing; the choices are a table in `priority_gates_every_fan_out_tests`. Two exceptions, both argued: `init` (writes the file from what it detects) and `check health` (reports on absent managers). | 2026-08-12 |

### H — the grading round of 2026-08-13 (GRADE-2026-08-13) — 8

*`docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` graded Bugs at Dâˆ’, Verification at D+, and refused the release. It
raised three questions it deliberately did not answer in code (Q-A, Q-B, Q-C), and the work on
F10 raised a fourth. **The owner ruled all four on 2026-08-13, by delegation**: asked to choose,
he declined to adjudicate them one by one and gave the principle instead — that a feature in this
codebase is **built fully, and not deferred because it is hard or potentially insecure**, because
within reason people are smart. H4 is the one that turns on that sentence, and it is ruled the
opposite way to the recommendation that was put to him.*

| | question | ruled |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | Is a declaration Shall was told to act on and could not a **failure of the run**, or a line that does not apply to this host? RULED: **a failure.** `sync` exits 1 and no longer returns `Converged` over it. | 2026-08-13 |
| **H2** | Should a read-only command that finds work exit 2, beyond `check`? RULED: **yes for `plan`, no for `list --outdated`.** | 2026-08-13 |
| **H3** | `outdated` — remove the dead name from the latency class table, or promote `list --outdated` to a subcommand? RULED: **remove the name; the flag stays a flag.** | 2026-08-13 |
| **H4** | Should `sandbox.fallback_allowed` default to `false`, so an unavailable sandbox refuses instead of running unconfined? RULED: **no — it stays `true`, and the run is made loud and honest instead.** | 2026-08-13 |
| **H5** | Is `StateResolver` (38 methods, 1,483 production lines) to be split, and are the three `Skipped` structs to be collapsed? RULED: **neither** — measured, argued, and the seam named for whenever something needs it. | 2026-08-13 |
| **H6** | Should `upgrade` run `exec:` steps, which only `sync` had ever run? RULED: **yes, and opted into per step** — `@on=sync\|upgrade\|both`, through the same approval gate, ledger and journal. A blanket widening would have handed every already-approved script to a verb nobody consented to. | 2026-08-13 |
| **H7** | Should `check` report managed-file *content* drift, given that `sync` heals it? RULED: **the premise was false — it already does.** Measured with a tampered destination rather than reasoned; reading `ChangePlanner` alone says otherwise because a `link:` is an extra and never reaches the planner. | 2026-08-13 |
| **H8** | Should a catalogue of known upgrade steps ship with the binary? RULED: **build it, as rows compiled in** — `exec:step/NAME` on a reserved prefix, no approval, argv rather than shipped scripts. Owner: *"aliases come defined in a text file and shipped. so yes."* | 2026-08-13 |

### J — the nightly and release round of 2026-08-14 to 2026-08-17 — 9

*Not a proposal part and not one grading document: these came out of the nightly integration legs
and the first published release. Each was raised by a leg that went red, or by a measurement taken
on a real machine, rather than by a review reading the tree — which is why several of them
overturn something the code was confident about. `J4` is the one entry here that is not finished:
the owner ruled its substance and one question under it is still his.*

| | question | ruled |
|---|---|---|
| **J1** | What guards `purge-undeclared` on a machine where the ratio is the only thing guarding it? The macOS nightly swept 276 packages unrefused: the ratio's denominator had quietly shrunk, and outside Linux the protected list named the OS's vocabulary, which no manager has ever reported. RULED: **favour power users, and make the unsafe part configurable.** | 2026-08-14 |
| **J2** | A `setting:` is never read back, so a sync that changed one reported that it changed nothing — and `plan` contradicted itself in two consecutive lines. RULED: **a bug.** Owner: *"yes, of course. this is a bug."* | 2026-08-16 |
| **J3** | `pacman`, `yay` and `paru` are three clients of one database, so every Arch machine counted each package three times and became unconvergeable. RULED: **the owner for a repository package, the helper for a foreign one** — no longer one answer. Owner: *"make it intuitive, easy, flexible and powerful."* | 2026-08-16 |
| **J4** | A plain `sync` honours a lockfile `shall lock` wrote as a side effect, so a machine stops syncing the day its archive drops a recorded version. **HALF RULED:** selective pinning, a switch per part, an error that explains itself and selective upgrade are ruled; **does a bare `shall lock` still freeze all three axes?** is not. | 2026-08-16 |
| **J5** | On NixOS, `nix profile install` is a side door the OS does not know about — two sources of truth for one machine, which is the condition this tool exists to remove. RULED: **Shall writes the system configuration and lets NixOS execute it**, four answers in one sitting. The published binary could not start on NixOS or Alpine at all until the static `musl` build. | 2026-08-16 |
| **J6** | `schedule:` reported nothing to do about a schedule it was about to rewrite — `J2`'s sibling, and `J2`'s fix does not transfer, because a schedule's name **is** its identity at the OS scheduler. RULED: **the durable fix.** Owner: *"feature rich and configurable, for power users."* | 2026-08-16 |
| **J7** | Three release questions: the version, whether `nixos:` ships in it, and whether there is a `shall doctor`. RULED: **`0.8.0`; yes; and no — there will not be one.** The handoff item that raised the third assumed a command that never shipped. | 2026-08-16 |
| **J8** | How does a bare package name reach a manager whose own names carry a category? RULED: **one matching atom resolves and the plan names it; more than one is refused, listing them.** `emerge` could not resolve one at all, and the leg that would have shown it was answering from crates.io. | 2026-08-17 |
| **J9** | Two guard messages named `--allow-mass-removal` whatever the caller passed, though `max_total_changes` answers to either flag — so a run of `--allow-mass-install` was told a removal count had been allowed by a flag it never typed, and a blocked one was told to authorize mass deletion to get its installs through. RULED: **name the flag the run passed; the total's refusal offers both.** | 2026-08-17 |

---

### L - the concurrency and efficiency audit of 2026-08-18 - 4

*From `docs/AUDIT-2026-08-18-concurrency.md`, which asked three questions of all 367 source files:
what costs more than it needs to, what blocks when it should not, and what races. Twenty-seven
findings; twenty-three were bugs against documented intent or mechanical applications of a pattern
already ruled on, and were built without stopping per `CLAUDE.md`. These four are what is left:
three trade-offs a user would notice, and one place Part II describes a locking model the code
deliberately no longer has.*

| | question | ruled |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Does the WAL flush per package on **success**, or once per wave? **ANSWERED 2026-08-18: make it the user's choice, defaulting to batching.** One setting, `[journal] flush_every`, default 32, `1` meaning flush every completion. What a crash in the window loses is a re-install of a package that is already installed, which recovery does anyway - and most of it can be read back off the disk next time. | Built the same day. |
| **L2** | Do the six `locks/` ledgers come under a lock of their own? **ANSWERED 2026-08-18: fix it in the most robust way.** Not by moving them - `locks/` is generated, in git, and yours, and relocating it would remove a feature to close a race. `LockFile::update` holds one lock across the load, the change and the save; every write that does not is named in a gate with the sentence that says why. | Built the same day. |
| **L3** | Do reader commands accept a torn cross-file view? **ANSWERED 2026-08-18: fix it, and the obvious fix is the wrong one.** A reader never waits on a writer; it detects one. `core::stable` reads the writer generation either side of a multi-file read and reads again if a writer committed in between. | Built the same day. |
| **L4** | Should Part II's II.8 gain the three-scope lock model - `Writer`, `Deferred`, `Reader`? **ANSWERED 2026-08-18: the docs match the code.** II.8 and II.24 rewritten, V.194 added, and V.61's claim that the lock covers the `locks/` ledgers corrected - it never did. | Built the same day. |

### M — the ecosystem-drift round of 2026-08-21, plus the audit's fail-open rail (M5) — 5

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | An upstream ecosystem broke and the nightly called it a Shall defect. Whose problem is drift, and what absorbs it? — RULED 2026-08-21: Shall's, and an excuse that has to be written down. | 2026-08-21 |
| **M2** | The same drift, on a user's machine: one `cabal:` line whose registry rotated a key stopped `sync` converging the two hundred declarations beside it. — RULED 2026-08-21: carry on past a failure Shall classed as passing, `[sync] continue_past_transient`, on by default. | 2026-08-21 |
| **M3** | `M2` documented a cost instead of fixing it: a batch fails as a unit, so one bad member still took the twenty-nine beside it down for that run. — RULED 2026-08-21: narrow the failed batch, `[sync] batch_recovery`, bisecting by default. | 2026-08-21 |
| **M4** | `--keep-going` raises a summary over what it carried past, and a summary was a `CommandFailed` — so the same refused declaration exited **3** without the flag and **1** with it, and a script that retries exit 1 retries a refusal. Found while fixing `VI.11`. — RULED 2026-08-21 (delegated): a run whose every member was refused is a refusal, and keeps exit 3. | 2026-08-21 |
| **M5** | The 2026-08-23 audit found the OS-essential rail failing open: `essential_names` turned a failed query into an empty set, which reads exactly like "nothing here is essential", so one manager having a bad day disarmed the protection for the whole run — `purge-undeclared` included. — RULED 2026-08-23 (delegated, audit shapes approved by the owner): **a failed essential query refuses removals through that backend for the run**, as `Objection::UnverifiedEssentials` — protection-class, no flag clears it. A backend not on this machine stays out of scope (II.7c). Leases, rebuild narrowing, rollback compensation and `shall protected` answer from the same query. (II.10, V.200) | 2026-08-23 |

### R — the audit-fix round of 2026-08-23/24 — 6

| | question | answered |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | The guard asks before the confirmation prompt (`remove-orphans`, `purge-undeclared`) and again in the engine over the same pairs, through one shared ledger — so eleven orphans passed the prompt and refused 22/20 after it. Who spends? — RESOLVED 2026-08-23 (delegated): **two asks, one rule, one spend** — `vet`/`vet_deliberate` decide without writing; the engine's ask records. (II.10, V.201) | 2026-08-23 |
| **R2** | An `@undo=` is an arbitrary shell command nothing can inspect — the one mutation family with no ceiling at all. Does it stay outside invariant 2? — RESOLVED 2026-08-23 (delegated): **charged, not exempt** — its batch answers `max_total_changes` as one charge (`charge_unmodelled`) before the first command runs; `--allow-mass-removal` clears it. Protected-name consultation does not apply: an opaque command has no name to match. (II.10, V.201) | 2026-08-23 |
| **R3** | A transaction killed part-way through 576 removals reported "Removed 0; 576 failed", and its WAL entries closed as Failed, which Q33 says heal walks past. What does a partial run owe the truth? — RESOLVED 2026-08-23 (delegated): completed removals that stayed removed are counted onto the engine's metrics and their entries close as **Abandoned**; both cleanup commands report real numbers and failed purges exit non-zero. (V.202) | 2026-08-23 |
| **R4** | `-y` auto-executed a vendor's installer script under a header promising "**Ask, then do**", and scheduled syncs inherited the posture. Where does unattended bootstrap consent live? — RULED 2026-08-23: **`--yes` never answers the bootstrap prompt by itself.** The consent is a preference — `[config] bootstrap_auto_yes = true`, default off — written by a human beside the repo it trusts. BUILT 2026-08-24. | 2026-08-23 |
| **R5** | Non-interactive `apply` with neither `--yes` nor a TTY applied, while identical conditions made `sync` refuse — opposite postures in the two most destructive commands. Which posture wins? — RULED 2026-08-23: **apply refuses like sync**; same sentence shape, `--yes` answers it, exit 3. BUILT 2026-08-24. | 2026-08-23 |
| **R6** | Configuration that supplies executable content has no permission/ownership gate, and pins end at install. Both were ruled in principle ("fix everything actionable"; exec-content gate config-selectable between owner-writable-only / world-writable-only / warn-only; pins honored everywhere with only explicit unpin commands escaping). — **ANSWERED 2026-08-24, both halves built.** The gate: `[exec] trust` (`II.61`, `V.204`). Pins past install: the whole-system upgrade refuses while a manifest-typed pin exists, `--ignore-pins` escapes (`II.62`, `V.205`); targeted and planner paths already bound pins. | 2026-08-23 |

# The blocking round — thirteen questions, all ruled

*These could not be built around: two reasonable implementations differed. Ruled 2026-07-23/24.*

## D3b

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** Nothing. No mode enum in `backends/artifact/`; `core/artifact_lock.rs:321` mentions download-only artifacts in a comment only.

**D3b — download-only artifacts (owner, 2026-07-20, raised with D3).** A `github:`/`web:` line may
ask Shall to **fetch an artifact without installing or managing it** — the `web:`-shaped case.
The two modes are different declarations and must not be one key wearing two meanings:

- **managed (default)** — Shall installs it, owns it, and **removes it when the line leaves the
  modules and profiles**, through the ordinary plan and guard.
- **download-only** — Shall fetches it to a known place and stops. It is still declared, so it is
  still removed when the declaration goes; what it is *not* is installed, shimmed, or on `PATH`.

*Owed:* the option's spelling, and whether a download-only artifact appears in `check` as
software (it is not software, so probably not). Recorded as **D3b, open**, not assumed.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes, a distinct download-only declaration — and it is the DEFAULT when a thing cannot be installed.** `web:`/`github:` may fetch an artifact without shimming it or putting it on PATH; it is still removed when the line goes. When Shall has no way to install the fetched thing (no shim target, no archive binary), download-only is what it does by default rather than failing. A separate meaning, not one key wearing two.

**RULED, NOT YET BUILT (2026-07-24).** A distinct download-only declaration, and the default when a fetched thing cannot be installed. Queued: it changes how `web:`/`github:` behave (a new mode in the install path), which is a semantic change to a core backend rather than an additive one. The ruling — a separate meaning, still removed when the line goes, download-only by default when uninstallable — is settled for when it is built.
---

## D5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today: BUILT (2026-07-26).** `github:`/`web:` hand a `.deb` to `dpkg -i` and an `.rpm` to `rpm -U` (`backends/artifact/system_pkg.rs` is the one place that argv is built); the lock records `installed_by`/`system_package` (`ArtifactLock`), removal routes back through the recorded manager (`dpkg -r`/`rpm -e`), and `installed_but_unmanaged` + `adopt`'s discovery subtract those names so `check` does not double-count and `purge-unmanaged` defers. `installable_here` now accepts a `.deb` only where `dpkg` exists and an `.rpm` only where `rpm` does — otherwise the line falls through to download-only. Unit-tested (argv, lock round-trip, dedup accessor, installer gating); only the live `dpkg -i`/`rpm -U` round-trip is deferred to a real apt/rpm box.

**D5 — A `deb` installed by `github` — who owns it?** `dpkg -i` puts it in apt's database. Now
`apt` can upgrade it out from under Shall, `shall check` may see it twice (once as a github
declaration, once as an apt-visible package), and the removal path has to know which tool to
call. **This is the "two of everything" failure at the package level**, and `purge-unmanaged`
(II.11) will have an opinion. *Recommendation:* the lock records the installing backend and
that backend owns removal; `check` must not double-count. Needs a real test against a real apt
box, not a mock.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): the installing backend owns it.** When `github:`/`web:` installs a file (a `.deb` handed to `dpkg`, etc.), the lock records which backend installed it, and that backend owns removal, upgrade and dedup — `check` does not report it twice, and `purge-unmanaged` defers to the recorded installer. This is the existing per-backend ownership (every managed package carries its backend); the `github:`-installs-a-`.deb` capability itself is separate and unbuilt, but the ownership rule is settled for when it lands.

**BUILD DIRECTIVE (owner, 2026-07-26): build it now, test the live install later.** No longer held back for an apt box. The capability — `github:`/`web:` handing a `.deb` to `dpkg -i` / an `.rpm` to `rpm -i`, the lock recording the installing backend, `check`'s dedup, and `purge-unmanaged`'s deference — is built now and unit-tested (argv construction, lock round-trip, dedup logic, purge deference). Only the live `dpkg -i` / `rpm -i` round-trip is deferred to a real apt/rpm box; it is exercised there, not claimed here.
---

## K2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** Nothing in `app/rebuild.rs` requires a scope.

**K2 — What is `rebuild`'s default scope?** `--all` on a bare `shall rebuild` is a very large
default for a command whose failure mode is an unbootable machine. *Recommendation:* require a
scope; a bare `rebuild` errors and lists the forms.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): warns, then rebuilds all.** A bare `shall rebuild` does NOT refuse — it rebuilds every declared package, but WARNS loudly first, because the failure mode is software missing from a machine and `--all` is a large thing to reach by pressing enter. The warning is the safeguard the built-to-recommendation used a refusal for; the owner chose warn-and-proceed. The old `bail` is replaced.
---

## K4

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** No `clean_cache_on_remove` key exists anywhere in `src/`.

**K4 — Is `clean_cache_on_remove` per-package on every backend, or only where Shall knows the
artifact?** Shall knows the file for `github:`/`web:`/`appimage:` (it is in `locks/`). For apt
or pacman it needs a new per-backend capability. *Recommendation:* download-backends only,
documented as such in the key's own description — a preference that silently does nothing on
most backends is worse than a narrower one that is honest.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): download-backends only, plus a user cache pointer and common-location search.** `clean_cache_on_remove` acts only where Shall knows the file (download backends: `github:`/`web:`/`appimage:`), documented as such in the key. ADDITIONALLY (owner): the user may point Shall at a cache directory, and Shall searches the common cache locations (`~/.cache`, `/var/cache`, XDG, each manager's own) so it can find and clean an artifact it did not download itself.

**RULED, NOT YET BUILT (2026-07-24).** `clean_cache_on_remove` (download backends only) + a user cache pointer + search of common cache locations. Queued: `clean_cache_on_remove` does not exist yet, so this is a new option plus a cache-search capability, not an additive tweak. The ruling — download-backends only, honest about doing nothing elsewhere; user may point at a cache; Shall searches `~/.cache`/`/var/cache`/XDG — is settled for when it is built.
---

## U1

**Status: ANSWERED — by 7a's approval, and BUILT 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `Layout::custom_backends_file()` — the config repo, and the only path any
loader reads.

**U1 — Where does a custom backend definition live?** Today `~/.config/shall/custom_backends.
toml`, machine-local, never in git — so a repo that uses `paru:` breaks on every machine but
the one where somebody hand-wrote the file. *Recommendation:* the config repo, as a
first-class file beside `priority` and `schedules`, with the machine-local path kept **only**
if there is a case for a definition that must not travel — and if there is not, deleted in the
same change rather than left as a second place to look. **The consequence that makes this a
decision and not an obvious fix:** a definition in the repo is argv that a shared repo can
execute, which is II.12's supply-chain surface. It must inherit the hook trust model, not a
new one.

**BUILT 2026-07-23, both halves.** The file is `<config_root>/custom_backends.toml`, read
through `Layout` like every other repo file; the machine-local path is deleted rather than kept
as a fallback, so `grep -rn "custom_backends" src/` finds one loader. **And it inherits the hook
model rather than getting one of its own**: the file's sha256 lives in `locks/hooks.toml` under
`backends:custom_backends.toml`, `shall lock` approves it, and an unapproved or edited file
registers **nothing** and says why. The check is at load rather than at the sync gate on purpose
— a registered backend is reachable from `search` and `list`, which no sync guards.

**One identity for the whole file, not one per definition.** A per-backend identity would let an
edit that *adds* a `[[backend]]` pass unnoticed, and adding one is the whole attack.

**Not decided here:** U2 (is a custom backend a full peer) and U16 (may `binary` be a path). U16
became reachable the moment `binary` existed, so it is refused for now — a definition naming
`/opt/vendor/thing` works on one machine, which is the property this entry moved the file to
fix — and the refusal says so rather than resolving the path.

---

## U3

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U3 — What does removing an `exec:` line mean?** Every other statement's removal undoes
something. A script has no inverse. *Recommendation:* an optional `@undo=` command; without it,
removing the line removes only the record, and `plan` says so in those words rather than
implying a revert that will not happen.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): as recommended.** An optional `@undo=<command>`; without one,
removing an `exec:` line drops the lock row and nothing else, and `plan` says so in those words
rather than implying a revert that will not happen. A script has no inverse, and inventing one
would be Shall claiming to undo something it cannot.

**AMENDED by U33 (owner, 2026-07-26): this ruling stands.** U33 lets `exec:` install software, but
does not give it an inverse — so an `exec:` that installs still leaves the software behind when the
line goes unless `@undo=` is written, and `plan` still says so. The removal contract here is
unchanged; only the *content* an `exec:` may carry widened.

---

## U9

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24, and BUILT.**

**U9 — Do the ten status commands collapse into one?** *Recommendation:* yes, one `shall check`
with sections and narrowing flags; `heal` stays separate because it acts. Old names deleted in
the same change (P2), not aliased.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes — "make it intuitive and easy" — and the repairs move to
`heal`.** Six commands are gone: `status`, `doctor`, `unmanaged`, `absent`, `conflicts`,
`audit`, folded into `shall check` with seven sections (`config`, `drift`, `unmanaged`,
`absent`, `conflicts`, `health`, `security`). Deleted, not aliased: an alias is the second way
to do one thing, kept alive.

**A section is a positional argument, not seven flags.** `shall check health` reads as a
question and `shall check --health` reads as a modifier; the ruling asked for intuitive, and
that is the difference. An unknown section is refused with the legal list printed, from the same
table the parser reads — so the error cannot drift from what is accepted.

**The default output is a verdict per section, each naming the command that acts on it** — P8:
a report whose next step is the reader working out what to run has done the easy half.

```
ok  config      42 package(s) declared
->  drift       3 to install, 1 to remove
                   run `shall sync`
->  unmanaged   103 package(s) Shall does not manage
                   run `shall adopt`
```

**`doctor --fix` is gone, and its three repairs are `heal`'s** (owner, asked and answered
2026-07-24): creating the II.1 directories, reconciling `locks/versions.json`, refreshing a
stale backend index. That is the whole dividing line the ruling rests on — **`check` looks,
`heal` acts** — and it is why `heal` survives the collapse. A command that both diagnoses and
repairs is one you cannot run to find out whether you want a repair.

**Two things the entry did not say, decided while building:**

- **A `config` section that fails stops the sections that depend on it.** Drift, absent and
  conflicts are all read off a resolved model; reporting "0 drift" from a model that failed to
  resolve would be a clean bill of health computed from nothing.

## U14

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24; safety story below.**

**U14 — Is sharing wanted, and what makes a vendored module safe to run?** Vendoring puts
someone else's files in your repo, and once `exec:` exists those files can contain a verb. The
defence on offer is that it lands as a reviewable diff, which is a real defence and a weak one —
nobody reads the whole diff. *Recommendation:* decide the safety story before deciding the
feature. The candidates are: vendor everything but refuse to run an `exec:` that arrived this way
without an explicit per-module opt-in; or vendor modules but never backend definitions and never
`exec:`; or do not build it. **This is blocking because building the convenient version first
and the safety story afterwards is how supply-chain incidents are written.**


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): build it.** Sharing is wanted, and a module may be referenced by a GitHub or other URL. A vendored module that carries code the repo can run (an `exec:` verb, a backend definition) needs an **opt-in to run**, and a flag or key must be able to force it. The precedent is the II.12 approval ledger and its siblings (`--allow-mass-removal`, `--replace-existing`, `@allow_http`, `@unverified`): refuse the dangerous thing by default, require one deliberate act to permit it. A vendored `exec:` is therefore approved the way every other script the repo runs is — `shall lock`, which means a human looked — and until then it does not run. **Still to design before building: how a URL reference is written (this changes `use takes a name, never a URL`, V.x), and whether a URL-vendored backend definition is allowed at all or only modules.**

**BUILT, 2026-07-24 (`shall add`).** `add <source>` vendors a source's shareable files (`modules/`, `adapters/`, `scripts/`) into the repo as a reviewable diff; `profiles/`, `active` and `priority` are left behind (the other machine's choices). Sources: `github:owner/repo`, any git URL, a raw file URL, a local path. A name collision is refused and named (`--force` overwrites). Vendored code (`exec:`, adapters) arrives UNAPPROVED and II.12 holds it until `shall lock` — `--trust` locks in the same step. A stranger's path that escapes the repo (`../../.bashrc`) is dropped by `safe_relative`; symlinks are not followed. Verified end to end: a vendored `exec:` refuses to run until approved.

## U19

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U19 — Is Shall acting for a user or for the machine?** Today: implicitly, whoever ran the
command — which the Linux backends mostly agree with by accident, and which the Windows registry
adapter (7e) cannot use, because `HKCU` and `HKLM` are a choice with no default that is right
for both. Three candidate answers, and they are not equally good:

1. **Shall is per-user, and system-wide is just what some managers happen to do.** Simplest, and
   it is roughly today's behaviour made explicit. It cannot express *"this setting applies to
   every account on this box"*, which is most of what a Windows or a shared Linux machine wants.
2. **`@scope=user|system` on the statements where it can vary** (`setting:`, `link:`, `shim:`),
   with a per-backend default. Precise, and it puts the question in front of the user at the one
   moment they know the answer. Costs a new option key on three statement kinds.
3. **The config repo declares its scope once**, at the top, and every line inherits it. One
   decision per repo rather than per line — and a machine that needs both then needs two repos,
   which is the wrong shape.

*Recommendation:* **2**, with a default per statement kind that matches what the underlying store
does anyway (`gsettings` â†’ user, registry â†’ `HKCU`, `apt` â†’ system). **Answer this before 7e is
written**, because whatever the registry adapter picks becomes the convention by precedent and
then spreads to macOS `defaults`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): option 2 — and writing the default is not an error.** `@scope=user`
on a store whose default is already user is accepted and means exactly what it says. A
configuration is allowed to state a thing it also gets for free: saying it out loud is how a
reader learns the answer without going to look it up, and refusing it would punish the person
being explicit.

**BUILT 2026-07-24, on the rule that nothing may silently ignore it (P7).** The key is accepted
on `setting:`, `link:` and `shim:` and refused on statements where the question does not arise
(`service:` is the init system's business, `schedule:` the timer's) — a key that means nothing
where it is written is a key that gets written there and quietly does nothing. A misspelling is
refused with both legal values named, because a typo that read as "the default" would be a line
that looks like a decision and behaves as if nobody made one.

**Where it is honoured, and where it is refused:**

- **`setting:`** — a `[[setting_store]]` row may carry `system_read`/`system_write`/
  `system_reset` beside the per-user three. A store that has them runs *different commands* per
  scope; a store that does not (`gsettings`) **refuses `@scope=system` by name** rather than
  writing the per-user value under a line that says every account. The read-before-write check
  reads in the same scope it will write, or it would compare two different settings and call
  them equal.
- **`shim:`** — refused for `system` today: Shall deploys shims only into this account's
  `~/.local/bin`, and a per-user shim under a line saying every account is the wrong answer
  quietly.
- **`link:`** — accepted and carried; the destination is already explicit in `@target=`, so
  there is nothing for it to change until ownership/permission handling exists.

**This unblocks 7e.** The registry adapter writes `HKCU` by default and `HKLM` under
`@scope=system`, and macOS `defaults` inherits the same convention — which is what the entry
said had to be settled before the first adapter was written.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): explicit per-line scope, default user.** Option (c): `@scope=user|system` on the statements where it can vary (`setting:`, `link:`, `shim:`), which is already built. The owner asked for a concrete default, and it is **user** — `Scope::resolve(written, Scope::User)`: an unspecified scope is per-user (HKCU, gsettings, `~/.local/bin`), and machine-wide (HKLM, `/etc`) requires writing `@scope=system`. Least privilege: changing every account's state is the deliberate case.

## U22

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U22 — Does the dotfiles tree link files, or directories?** One symlink at `~/.config/nvim`
is a single operation and takes the whole directory hostage: everything the application later
writes there — caches, session files, a plugin lockfile — lands inside the git-tracked config
repo, and `bundle` then hands it to whoever the backup goes to. Linking each *file* leaves the
directory the user's and puts nothing in the repo that was not put there deliberately, at the
cost of walking the tree every sync and of one ledger row per file. *Recommendation:* per
file. **The consequence that makes it a decision rather than an obvious fix:** per-file linking
cannot express *"this directory is entirely mine"*, which is what a `nvim` config under version
control usually is — so if the answer is per-file, the directory case needs its own spelling
later rather than being reachable by accident.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): per file, as recommended.** One symlink at `~/.config/nvim`
takes the whole directory hostage: every cache, session file and plugin lockfile the application
later writes lands inside the git-tracked repo, and `bundle` then hands it to whoever the backup
goes to. Linking each file leaves the directory the user's and puts nothing in the repo that was
not put there deliberately.

---

## U23

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U23 — What happens to a destination that already holds the user's own file?** `link:`
answers this one file at a time with `backup_once`. A tree asks it forty times on the first
sync of a new machine, which is precisely the machine where the home directory is full of
files a distribution's defaults put there. Silently backing up forty files is not a preview,
and refusing on the first collision leaves the sync half-applied. *Recommendation:* the plan
lists every colliding destination **before** anything is written and the run is refused until
the user says which way; `--adopt-existing` (or whatever it ends up called) is the one-word
answer for "back them all up". This must be settled before the walker is written, because a
tree that half-links is worse than one that does not run.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): as recommended, plus an explicit bypass.** The plan lists every
colliding destination *before* anything is written and the run is refused until they have been
seen — silently backing up forty files is not a preview, and refusing on the first collision
leaves the sync half-applied.

**And there is a flag to proceed anyway** (owner's addition): the common case on a fresh machine
is that every colliding file is a distribution default nobody edited, and making the user
acknowledge forty of those one at a time is a refusal that teaches people to bypass refusals. The
flag is explicit and per-run; it is never a config key, because a machine that always bypasses
this is a machine where the check does not exist.

## U24

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U24 — Is a `.age` file in the tree a secret?** XII's decrypt mode is an option on a `link:`
line, and this statement has no per-file options by construction. Either the extension decides
(magic, and magic that silently writes plaintext), or encrypted files are simply not this
statement's job and stay on explicit `link:` lines. *Recommendation:* the second — **the tree
never decrypts.** T2 is already an open finding about plaintext landing in the config repo, and
a folder walker that decrypts by filename convention is the same failure with more surface.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): the tree never decrypts.** An `.age` file in the dotfiles tree
is copied as the ciphertext it is. Deciding by file extension is magic, and magic that silently
writes plaintext; secrets stay on explicit `link:` lines where `@decrypt=` is written down.

---

## U26

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U26 — Is BSD a supported platform, and if so what does `when family` answer there?** (XIII.22.)
Two questions, and only the second is blocking: registering `pkg`/`pkg_add` is ordinary backend
work that can happen whenever, but **`when family` has no answer on a BSD today and silently
returns the else branch**, so a config that is correct on Linux is quietly wrong there rather
than refused. *Recommendation:* decide the identifier before either backend is written —
`freebsd`/`openbsd`/`netbsd` as families beside `debian`/`arch`, sourced from `uname -s` when
`/etc/os-release` is absent, and **an unidentifiable host is an error, not an empty string**,
because an empty family is what makes every `when` block silently false. The support question
itself is the owner's: P7 is already unpaid on `setting:` (GNOME-only) and the snapshot promise
(Linux-only), and a third platform admitted before the second is honest turns the principle into
a slogan. A legitimate answer is *"listed, dated, not scheduled"* — what is not legitimate is
leaving `family` returning a wrong answer on a platform whose package manager Shall already
drives (`pkgin` is registered today).


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): a family that cannot be shown to be X makes `family == X` false, not an error.** The owner rejected the hard-error option: an unidentifiable or non-matching family simply fails the positive comparison, because it cannot be demonstrated to be that family. This is already the behaviour — `HostFacts::current` falls back to `std::env::consts::OS`, which is `freebsd`/`openbsd`/`netbsd` on the BSDs, so `family` answers the OS name there and `== debian` is correctly false. The build is a test locking that in and a why note; BSD backend registration (`pkg`/`pkg_add`) is ordinary work for whenever.

# The non-blocking round — forty-six questions, all ruled

*Something could still be built around each of these. Ruled 2026-07-23 through 2026-07-26; the U27–U38 extension-surface set closed last, on 2026-07-26.*

## U27

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U27 — Is the snapshot/rollback layer opened to a registry and config-driven providers, the way
backends are, or do new providers stay hand-written Rust? (XIII.23.)** Today `SnapshotProvider`
is a seven-method trait and the four providers (btrfs, zfs, timeshift, `windows_restore`) are a
hardcoded vec in `SnapshotManager::new` (`snapshot.rs:528`), first-available active. Adding
APFS/LVM/bcachefs/WinBtrfs is a full Rust impl each. Two reasonable answers: **(a)** a
`SnapshotProviderRegistry` plus a config-driven provider and a `custom_snapshots.toml`, matching
the backend model — a create/list/delete/restore filesystem becomes ~thirty lines of data;
**(b)** a registry only — providers stay Rust, but pluggable and no longer a hardcoded vec — on
the grounds that a provider which gets `restore_capability` wrong bricks a machine (V.60), a
higher bar than a package listing and maybe too high for a TOML file. *Recommendation:* (a),
with the one constraint that makes it safe — **`restore_capability` is never inferred**: a
provider whose config does not prove it can restore a running system is create-only
(`NotFromRunningSystem`), never `Live`, so the worst a wrong config does is decline an undo it
could have offered, never perform one it cannot keep. Ownership marking (S3) must be expressible
or retention is disabled for that provider; a custom provider registers last and never shadows a
built-in (XIII.2's rule).

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): option (a), the full plugin — and the restore capability is a value
the plugin author enters, not one Shall guesses.** A snapshot provider is a declared block (the
same shape as a custom backend and a `[[setting_store]]`): the commands to take, list, delete and
restore a snapshot, as data in a file in the config repo. No new release is needed to teach Shall
a new snapshot technology.

- **The plugin must state whether it can restore a *running* machine** — the one thing that
  cannot be inferred (V.60): taking a snapshot and restoring one over the live system are
  different abilities, and a wrong guess is a machine reported safe that is not. The author writes
  it because the author knows it. Restore-capability is a **required field with no default**;
  omitting it is a loud error naming the provider, never a silent "assume it can" or "assume it
  can't". A provider declared unable to restore a running system is create-only — it saves state
  and refuses the rollback rather than attempting one it cannot finish.
- **It must work for everything, so the built-ins use the same door.** btrfs, zfs, timeshift and
  Windows System Restore stop being a hardcoded list and become rows read through the one loader a
  user's row goes through — the K17/U1 rule, so the mechanism is proven by the shipped providers
  and cannot drift into a privileged path nobody tested. APFS, LVM, bcachefs and the rest are then
  data, not code.
- **It must be easy to add.** One file, roughly thirty lines of data, beside the other adapters in
  `adapters/` (U10), under the II.12 hook ledger because it is argv a shared repo can run —
  approved by `shall lock`, the same trust answer already given for custom backends and settings
  stores, not a new one.

**Implementing calls (owner ruled the shape; these follow from it):** a custom provider registers
last and never shadows a built-in (XIII.2); ownership marking (S3) must be expressible in the row
or retention is disabled for that provider; a row missing `restore` or a required capability field
is refused at load, not half-used. This makes providers plural, which is what **U28** (choose the
active provider by capability, not list order) now has to answer.

**RULED (owner decision session 2026-07-26): the "built-ins become rows too" half is Option A —
build it now, no permanent exemption.** The additive `ConfigSnapshotProvider` shipped 2026-07-27;
this closes the other half the original ruling asked for — the built-ins stop being a hardcoded
`Vec` (`core/snapshot.rs:528`) and go through the one loader, so the mechanism is proven by the
shipped providers and cannot drift into a privileged path nobody tested (the K17/U1 invariant).

- **btrfs, zfs, timeshift and lvm become argv rows** in `adapters/snapshot.toml`. Their live
  restore is validated on a Linux box with those filesystems afterwards; the argv and wiring are
  unit-tested here.
- **Windows System Restore becomes a row too — but via typed-placeholder substitution, not a
  free-text template.** This was the one point that needed the owner: Windows System Restore is
  typed PowerShell cmdlets (`Checkpoint-Computer`, `Restore-Computer -RestorePoint {id}`) run
  elevated, and SEC5 closed an injection hole there by making the id a `u32` and the label a fixed
  enum. The owner ruled it stays a row rather than a hand-written exemption, on the condition that
  the loader substitutes the id only as a validated `u32` and the label only as the enum value —
  never raw interpolation — so SEC5's property is preserved by construction. This is buildable and
  testable on the Windows host itself, so nothing about the Windows row waits on foreign hardware.
  Reasoned in **V.82**.

## U28

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U28 — Does a machine use one snapshot provider or several, and is the active one chosen by
capability rather than list order? (XIII.23.)** `SnapshotManager::new` takes the first available
provider and stops. But a machine can have a btrfs `/` and a ZFS data pool at once, and they are
not equal: ZFS restores a running system live, btrfs cannot (V.60). Choosing by vec order means
a btrfs-first machine silently gets the weaker safety net when a live-capable one is present.
*Recommendation:* prefer a `Live` provider over a create-only one when both are available,
independent of registration order; leave "several active at once" (snapshot every provider,
restore from the best) as a later question, since one strong provider is the safety net and N is
an optimization. Blocked by nothing — but it is the wrong default to leave in place once U27
makes providers plural.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): a declared priority list, exactly like package managers.** The active
provider is not chosen by Shall guessing from capability, and not by whatever order the providers
were registered — it is chosen by an **ordered list the user declares**, the same mechanism
package-manager `priority` already is: the first provider in the list that is available on this
machine becomes the active safety net. A default order ships and the user overrides it, exactly as
`priority` does for backends.

- **The list decides *which* provider; V.60 decides what Shall *promises* about it.** These do not
  conflict. If the declared order puts a create-only provider first, Shall uses it and **says so
  before the change** — the pre-change notice states which kind of snapshot this machine takes, so
  a weaker net is a visible choice, never a silent one. A provider that cannot restore a running
  machine still refuses the rollback; the list cannot make it promise what it declared it cannot
  do.
- **One active provider, first-available-wins.** "Snapshot with every provider and restore from
  the best" (belt-and-suspenders) stays a later question — one strong provider is the safety net;
  N is an optimisation, not the floor.

**Implementing call:** the ordered list is its own preference, sitting with the snapshot settings
rather than jammed into package `priority` — one-question-per-file (U10) — but it *is* the
`priority` shape (an ordered list of names, default shipped, user overrides), not a new one.

---

## U29

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U29 — Is APFS local-snapshot the macOS safety net, and does an APFS restore count as `Live` or
`NotFromRunningSystem`? (XIII.24.)** U6 is ruled — the Linux-only snapshot promise is documented
as such — but macOS ships APFS with local snapshots (`tmutil localsnapshot`, `diskutil apfs`)
and Shall uses none of it, so the pre-sync snapshot / `rebuild` revert / `rollback` are simply
absent on the second supported platform. An `ApfsProvider` is the natural first customer of
U27's registry. *Recommendation:* build it, and answer the capability honestly — an APFS
snapshot that can only be restored by rebooting into the recovery environment is
`NotFromRunningSystem`, not `Live` (V.60). Whether macOS parity is *scheduled* or merely *listed*
(XIII.4) is the owner's call; the *capability* question must be answered before the provider
ships, whenever that is.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): yes — macOS gets APFS as its snapshot provider, and it is built.**
APFS local snapshots (`tmutil localsnapshot`, `diskutil apfs`) become the macOS safety net, as a
provider row on U27's mechanism — the natural first customer of the plugin door. Its restore
capability is declared honestly: an APFS snapshot restored only by rebooting into the recovery
environment is **create-only, not live** (V.60), so it saves state and offers recovery-mode
restore rather than pretending to be a running-machine undo. This closes the platform gap U6
documented: macOS is no longer without a net, it has a create-only one, marked as such.

**Governance (owner, 2026-07-26): there is no "listed but not scheduled" — everything ruled to
build gets built.** The recommendation offered scheduling as the owner's call; the owner removed
the option. **The XIII.4 listed-vs-scheduled distinction is retired.** A decision that says "build
it" is scheduled work, not an acknowledgement filed for later, and this applies to every "open it
/ build it" ruling in this register.

## U30

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U30 — Is "declare a storage object" a family (zfs datasets, lvm volumes, btrfs subvolumes) or
separate backends, and what does the guard owe a removal that destroys a filesystem? (XIII.25.)**
`backends/btrfs.rs` declares subvolumes as objects; there is no zfs-dataset or lvm-volume
equivalent, though each is the same declared-sized-mounted noun. They do not fit `ManagerConfig`,
so it is Rust regardless — the question is one shared trait versus three backends. *The half that
is not cosmetic:* `btrfs:` remove runs `subvolume delete`, which destroys a filesystem, and a
zfs-dataset `remove` (`zfs destroy`) is the same at larger blast radius. **Every removal path
calls the guard (`app/sync/guard.rs`), and this one must too — verified from the code, not
assumed** (the II.10 lesson: a removal path nobody names is a removal path nobody guards).
*Recommendation:* settle the guard's contract for filesystem objects — at minimum, a declared
storage object with data on it is never destroyed without the gate a protected package gets —
before any second storage backend grows a `remove`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): one family, and the ordinary guard — no special escalation.**

- **Shape: one family.** zfs datasets, lvm volumes and btrfs subvolumes are the same
  declared-sized-mounted noun, so they share one trait, not three backends. (The owner agreed the
  cosmetic half.)
- **Guard: the normal gate, and it must fire.** A removal that destroys a filesystem goes through
  `app/sync/guard.rs` exactly as a protected-package removal does — the same mass-removal-style
  confirmation, no stronger dedicated gate and no refuse-to-auto-destroy special case. What is
  **not** optional is that the guard fires at all: this is a removal path, it destroys a
  filesystem, and II.10 says every removal path calls the guard — so a `zfs destroy` / `subvolume
  delete` reached by removing a line is never silent, it is guarded like any destructive change.
  The owner chose the normal gate over the two stricter options (empty-only auto-destroy;
  never-auto-destroy-a-populated-volume) — a storage removal is guarded, not special-cased.

The line that was genuinely open — *does a filesystem-destroying removal earn MORE than the normal
gate* — is answered **no**. It earns exactly the guard every removal earns, and the danger is met
by the guard firing, not by a second heavier gate.

**And a storage object is protectable exactly like a package (owner, 2026-07-26).** The guard's
existing protection — the `keep.txt` / "never remove" mark a user puts on a package the guard then
refuses to remove — applies to storage objects too: a user may protect a volume, and a protected
volume the guard **refuses to destroy** at all, the same way it refuses a protected package. This
is not a new mechanism; it is the one protection vocabulary reaching a new noun, which is the
right shape (no two of everything). So the danger has two answers together: the guard fires on
every storage removal (the normal gate), and a volume a user cares about can be marked so the
guard will not destroy it even then.

**What has actually been executed, recorded 2026-08-18 because three documents said "unrun"
while it was running.** The `storage` leg destroys a real object through Shall on every run and
asserts it is gone from `list`: a btrfs subvolume and an LVM logical volume since 2026-07-31, and
a ZFS dataset since today (CI 32132445664). `README.md`, `plan.md` item 0c and `BUILDER.md` all
carried "argv-tested and unrun" for eighteen days after the first half of that stopped being
true, and all three are corrected.

**The half still unexecuted is the protection, and it is the half that matters most.** No gate
has ever marked a storage object protected and watched the guard refuse to destroy it. It is also
the one item in this area that **cannot** be argv-tested, because a refusal never reaches a
manager and so produces no argv to assert — a live run is its only possible proof. That is a
lifecycle step the harness does not have yet, not a ruling in question.

**Build note (owner, 2026-07-26): the providers do not exist yet and must actually be built.**
Only `backends/btrfs.rs` declares storage objects today; **zfs datasets and lvm volumes have no
implementation at all.** This ruling is the contract for code that is still owed — the shared
family trait, the zfs (`zfs create`/`destroy`/list) and lvm backends, the guard wiring and the
protection mark — all of it is work to do, not work done. Do not read this entry as "storage
objects are finished."

## U31

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U31 — Should health checks be an open vocabulary — a user-declared check command — rather than
a fixed set? (XIII.26.)** A health-checked upgrade (XIII.5) rolls back when the machine is
"unhealthy", but health is only what Shall already knows how to test; a user whose service must
answer on a port, or whose config file must parse, cannot express it. A check is argv with exit
0 = healthy — the most check-shaped extension there is. *Recommendation:* open it, on the II.12
hook trust model (a check command is argv from a file, and the file may travel), and fail loud —
a check that cannot run is a failed check, not a passed one, or "healthy" quietly comes to mean
"the check was broken" (V's silent-wrongness). Not blocking: the built-in checks work; this is
the difference between a safety net Shall designed and one the user can shape.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): open it, as recommended.** Health checks become an open vocabulary —
a user declares a check command (argv, exit 0 = healthy) beside the built-in checks. Two rules,
both the standard ones:

- **Fail loud: a check that cannot run is a *failed* check.** If Shall cannot execute the check,
  the result is "unhealthy" and the change rolls back — never "assume healthy". Otherwise "healthy"
  silently degrades to "the check was broken", the exact silent-wrongness this design refuses.
- **Same trust as every runnable thing:** a check command is argv a shared config repo can carry,
  so it rides the II.12 hook ledger and is approved by `shall lock`, not a new trust model.

The exact schema is implementation, not a further ruling.

## U32

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U32 — Do modules take parameters (the macro Shall doesn't have), and is a parameter's type
checked? (XIII.29.)** A module is a named set of declarations that cannot take an argument, so two
machines wanting *almost* the same set copy it and drift. *Proposed:* `param user` / `param gpu =
none` in the module, `use workstation(user=shaul, gpu=nvidia)` at the call site; substitution is
`vars`' existing interpolation reaching into the module's parameters, and the expansion is
ordinary declarations, visible in `shall eval` and the removal preview before it runs. A missing
`param` with no default is a **loud error naming module and parameter**, never an empty string
that makes a `when` silently false (P3, the failure `vars` was hardened against). *The actual
decision:* whether a parameter is typed — a `gpu` that must be one of a named set versus free text.
A typed parameter is a second closed vocabulary the user defines: it names its legal values in the
error (VIII.2's virtue) but is also a second place a name can be misspelled. *Recommendation:*
build parameters; make types opt-in (free text with a loud "missing" is the floor, a named set is
sugar on top), so the feature is useful before the type system is finished.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): build it, and the user decides per parameter whether it is typed.**
Modules take parameters — `param user`, `param gpu = none` in the module, `use workstation(user=
shaul, gpu=nvidia)` at the call site, substituted through `vars`' existing interpolation, expanding
to ordinary declarations visible in `shall eval` and the removal preview before anything runs. Two
things are fixed:

- **A missing required parameter is a loud error naming the module and the parameter** — never an
  empty string that makes a `when` silently false (P3, the failure `vars` was hardened against).
- **Types are the user's choice, per parameter.** Free text is the floor; a user may declare a
  parameter typed (a named set of legal values, whose error lists them — VIII.2's virtue) where
  they want that check, and leave it free text where they do not. The same principle as the rest of
  this round — the user can shape it — applied to the parameter's own vocabulary. Opt-in, so the
  feature is useful before any type system is finished, and never forced where free text is fine.

## U33

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26 (owner overrode the recommendation; amends U3 and U4).**

**U33 — Are generated declarations wanted at all — a config that runs a program to *produce*
state, not describe it? (XIII.30.)** `vars` already lets a *value* come from a command through the
hook ledger; this is a whole *declaration* from a command ("install whatever `./pick-python.sh`
prints"). It is `read`/`eval` with `read`/`eval`'s liability: the config's behaviour stops being
knowable by reading it. Shall already treats the neighbouring feature as radioactive — `exec:` is
"run a thing", and U3/U4 confined it to actions with no inverse, explicitly *not* installing
software; a generator that emits installs walks back to that line, now able to *generate* the
`exec:` (XIII.14's fear). If ever built, only under exec's constraints: output passes the guard
and the removal preview as if typed; it runs through the II.12 ledger (V.55); a failed generator
is a failed sync, never a silently empty set (VI.0). *Recommendation:* **not yet, and possibly
never.** `vars` covers values, U32 covers reuse, and what remains is precisely the unknowable-by-
reading property this design exists to refuse. Filed so the answer is a recorded *no* rather than
a gap someone fills quietly.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): build it — and `exec:` may do anything — each gated by a config key.**
The recommendation was a recorded no; the owner overrode it deliberately. Both powers ship, and
both are **off by default behind an explicit config key** — the deliberate opt-in shape Shall
already uses for every dangerous capability (`--allow-mass-removal`, `@allow_http`, `shall lock`).
A user who wants the power turns the key; a user who does not is never exposed to it.

- **Generated declarations exist.** A config may run a program that *produces* declarations, gated
  by its own key. What it emits is **not** exempt from the machine's safety: the output passes the
  guard and the removal preview exactly as if it had been typed, it runs through the II.12 approval
  ledger (V.55), and a failed generator is a **failed sync, never a silently empty set** (VI.0,
  fail-loud — a Part I principle, so it holds regardless of the key). The key buys the
  unknowable-by-reading tradeoff; it does not buy silence.
- **`exec:` may install software and do anything, gated by its own key. This amends U3 and U4.**
  U4 said `exec:` is not a licence to install software; the owner has lifted that categorical
  refusal and replaced it with a key. U3 still governs *removal*: `exec:` has no automatic inverse,
  so an `exec:` that installs still leaves the software when the line goes unless `@undo=` is given,
  and `plan` still says so. The onboarder remains the **better** path for anything installable (it
  gives a noun that removes/lists/locks); it is no longer the *only* permitted one.
- **Two keys, not one** ("a key which controls each") — generated declarations and `exec:`-anything
  are separately gated, so enabling one does not silently enable the other.

**Downstream, owed:** U3 and U4 entries carry an amendment note pointing here; the README's `exec:`
boundary (U4's deliverable) and XIII.14's fear are revisited when this is built. The Part I
principles (fail-loud, the guard, the plan showing every change) are **not** waived by either key —
they are what keeps an opened door from being a silent one.

## U34

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U34 — Is `shall repl` worth a second entry point, or is `shall eval | jq` enough? (XIII.31.)** A
read-only prompt that resolves a name against *this* machine, evaluates a `when`, and expands a
`use workstation(gpu=nvidia)` — answering "what does this resolve to here" by trying it. It is
`eval` (XIII.15) with a cursor and must share the same parser and resolver, never a second
implementation (the U20 rule). *Recommendation:* low priority — real value for anyone authoring a
config, but `eval` already exposes the model, so this is ergonomics, not capability. Worth it only
if it stays a thin front end over the existing engine.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): build it — if it is easy.** `shall repl` ships as an interactive
read-only prompt for authoring a config. The owner did not require it be a literal thin wrapper,
only that it be easy — so the implementation shape is free, **with one non-negotiable that is a
correctness rule, not a style choice: it shares the one parser and resolver, never a second
implementation (U20).** Two engines drift and then disagree, which is the failure this rewrite
exists to end; that constraint holds however the repl is structured. It is ergonomics over the
model `eval` already exposes, so if it turns out not to be easy while staying single-engine, it is
not worth a half-build.

---

## U35

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26 (owner widened past composition-only).**

**U35 — May a user name a new verb, strictly as a composition of built-ins? (XIII.31.)** Shall has
~sixty commands (XIII.8) and no way to add the sixty-first. A verb that *sequences* existing verbs
— `shall refresh` = `sync`, then `upgrade`, then the fleet report — is `defun` over the command
surface, and safe because it composes audited operations rather than producing new ones. **The
line:** a user verb sequences built-in verbs and nothing else; the moment it runs arbitrary argv it
is `exec:` wearing a command's clothes, which U4 already settled as no. *Recommendation:* build it
with that boundary hard-coded — composition only, no shell — so the safe 90% ships without
reopening the `exec:` trust question the dangerous 10% would.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): build it, and a user verb may run arbitrary commands too.** The
recommendation held the line at composition-only; the owner widened it, consistent with U33 letting
`exec:` do anything. So a user verb has two registers, and **one door, not two**:

- **Composing built-in verbs is safe and ungated.** `shall refresh` = `sync`, then `upgrade`, then
  the fleet report — it sequences audited operations and produces nothing new, so it needs no key.
- **Running arbitrary commands rides the `exec:` trust model from U33.** The moment a user verb
  runs argv of its own, that portion is the same power `exec:` is, so it inherits the same
  controls: gated behind U33's `exec:`-anything config key (off by default), approved through the
  II.12 ledger, and never exempt from the guard, the plan and fail-loud (Part I). It does **not**
  get a second, looser trust question of its own — that is the mistake the composition-only
  recommendation was guarding against, and routing arbitrary-command verbs through U33's existing
  gate answers it without a new mechanism.

---

## U36

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U36 — Are init systems a declared-provider kind, or does the built-in enum stay closed? (XIII.34.)**
`backends/service.rs` is a fixed `enum InitSystem` (Systemd, OpenRC, SysVinit, launchd, Windows
`sc`) behind a hardcoded command table; s6, dinit, runit, GNU Shepherd and appliance inits are
unreachable, and a `service:` line on such a host has no branch to take. It is the snapshot vec's
problem in another file, and the **lowest-risk** surface to open — start/stop/enable are ordinary
reversible operations with no data to destroy. *Recommendation:* open it as a `[[init]]` block on
XIII.33's mechanism; it is the cleanest fit the mechanism has, and P7 is better served by "write
six lines" than by "unsupported". Not blocking — the five built-ins cover most machines.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): open it, as recommended.** Init systems become a declared-provider
kind — a `[[init]]` block on the same plugin mechanism as custom backends, setting stores and
snapshot providers, so s6, dinit, runit, GNU Shepherd and any appliance init are reachable by
writing a small file rather than shipping a release. The five built-ins become rows read through
the same loader (no two of everything), and a declared init system is argv a shared repo can carry,
so it rides the II.12 ledger and `shall lock` approves it. This is the lowest-risk surface —
start/stop/enable are reversible and destroy no data — so nothing beyond the standard trust rule
is owed. The schema is implementation.

---

## U37

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**U37 — Are notification channels their own declared-provider kind, or is an event hook the
answer? (XIII.35.)** `app/scheduler/notify.rs` handles only `desktop`, `email`, `both` and warns
"unknown channel" for the rest, so Slack, ntfy, webhooks, Telegram, paging — every channel a real
fleet uses — is absent. **The overlap with XIII.13's event hooks is the decision:** a hook can
already shell out to `curl` on a sync or a guard refusal, so "notify me on Slack" is *possible*
today; the question is whether a first-class `[[channel]]` block earns its keep on top of that.
*Recommendation:* do not add a second mechanism — route non-built-in channels through the event
hook that already exists, and document it — unless a channel needs something a hook cannot express
(per-level routing), the only thing that would justify a block of its own. Filed so the answer is
a recorded decision, not a fifth channel bolted on next time someone asks.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): no new mechanism — route through the existing event hook, and
document it.** Slack, ntfy, webhooks, Telegram and paging are reached by the event hook U15 already
shipped (a hook that runs `curl` on `after_sync` / `on_drift` / `on_guard_refusal`), not by a new
`[[channel]]` provider kind. A dedicated channel block would duplicate the hook — two ways to do
one thing, the disease this rewrite cures. The one thing that could have justified a block of its
own, per-severity routing, the owner did not ask for, so it is not built. The work owed here is
**documentation** — a copyable Slack/webhook hook example — not a mechanism. If per-level routing
is ever wanted, that, and only that, reopens the block question.

---

## U38

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26. The T-series gate is now clear.**

**U38 — Is secret decryption a declared-provider kind, and behind which T-series rulings?
(XIII.36.)** `model/secret.rs` is built around `age` (age plugins, hardware tokens); sops, Vault,
1Password, cloud KMS and GPG have no way in, though each is "run a command that turns a reference
into plaintext" — XIII.33's shape exactly. **This is the surface where openness is not cheap.** A
decrypt provider's output *is* a secret: a bad one writes plaintext to disk, leaves it in the
process table, or logs it — the failure `secret:` exists to prevent. So a declared secret provider
is bound by the T-series handling rules Shall argued for age (no-disk / in-memory / no-log, T7
reopened), and one that cannot promise them is refused, not trusted. *Recommendation:* yes in
principle — the mechanism is identical and users genuinely have other secret managers — but **not
before the T-series settles how plaintext is handled**, because opening this surface first hands an
unaudited command the one thing Shall promises to guard. Safe order: rule the T-series, then open
the door the mechanism already makes trivial.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): open it — the T-series is settled, so the gate is clear.** The
plaintext-handling rules this surface waited on are all ruled: decrypt never silently backs up
(T1), plaintext cannot be written back into the repo (T2), it is created with locked-down
permissions (T5), and Shall does not hold secrets in process memory (T7, ruled out). With those
fixed, secret decryption becomes a declared-provider kind — sops, Vault, 1Password, cloud KMS and
GPG reachable on the same plugin mechanism and `shall lock` approval as every other surface.

- **The safety cost is real and is paid by a refusal, not a warning.** A decrypt provider's output
  *is* a secret, so a declared provider is **bound by the T-series handling rules** (no plaintext
  to disk, none left in the process table, none logged), and **one that cannot promise them is
  refused, not trusted.** Openness here is not free the way it is for init systems (U36): the
  provider proves it handles plaintext safely, or it does not run.
- Everything ruled gets built (2026-07-26 governance), so this is scheduled work, not a filed
  intention — now that its gate is open.

## U39

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-26.**

**In the tree today:** built in the same commit as this ruling. `capability::INSTALLS_FROM_SOURCE`
is the one table — `("helm", "url")` — read by both ends: the grammar admits `@url` as a package
option and refuses it by name on every backend that installs by name, and `register_helm` builds
its `ManagerConfig::install_source_option` from the same row. Both harnesses run helm's full
lifecycle where they previously named it as an open bug and skipped it.

**The first version of this shipped broken, and only a real `helm` said so.** The unit tests built
a `PackageSpec` by hand, so nothing ever asked the grammar whether `@url` was a legal key — and it
was not: II.2's option table is closed, so every `helm:diff@url=…` line was refused as a
misspelling while every test passed. `capability.rs` now has a test that every install-source key
is in `PACKAGE_OPTION_KEYS`, which is the drift this could otherwise repeat.

**U39 — When a manager installs by one string and removes by another, which one is the
declaration?** `helm plugin install` takes a URL; `helm plugin list` and `helm plugin uninstall`
speak the name in the plugin's own `plugin.yaml`. A Shall declaration carries one name, so
whichever half it named, the other half broke — and naming the URL is the half that breaks
**silently and permanently**: the install succeeds, then every later sync sees a package that
`list` never mentions, tries to remove it, and fails identically. One helm plugin wedged every
operation after it. Proven by a real run on the `tools` image, and it is not helm-specific in
principle — it is the general question of which string is the identity.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): the name is the identity, always. Install-time data rides in an
option.** A declaration is `helm:diff@url=https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff`.

- **The identity is the string the manager will still answer to later.** Install runs once;
  list and remove run on every sync forever. A declaration that names the install argument is
  a declaration Shall can never check or undo, which is the opposite of what a declarative
  model is for.
- **A declaration missing its source is refused, not guessed.** Deriving `diff` from
  `.../helm-diff` is right often enough to be trusted and wrong often enough to install a
  plugin under a name nothing can remove; the real name lives in a `plugin.yaml` that cannot
  be read before the plugin is fetched. The refusal names the fix.
- **`go` already had the right shape and is why this is a rule rather than a helm patch.**
  `go install` takes a module path and Go ships no uninstaller, but the module path is what
  `go version -m` reports back, so the identity survives — and removal derives the binary from
  it. `web` is consistent the other way (the URL is the identity at install, list *and*
  remove). helm was the only backend where the two vocabularies differed and the code assumed
  they did not.

---

## U40

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-27.**

**In the tree today:** built in the same commit as this ruling. `RawExecutor` carries a
`ChildStdin` policy — `Closed` for the reader layer, `Interactive` for the mutating one — and
captures stdout and stderr on both. `run_on` sets `SYSTEMD_PAGER`/`PAGER`/`GIT_PAGER` on every
spawn, and the systemd rows in `init_providers.toml` carry `--no-pager`.

**U40 — Does a command Shall runs write to your terminal, or to Shall?** It had been answered
by accident, and both ways at once: `RawExecutor::execute` asked whether *Shall's own stdin* was
a terminal and, if it was, handed the child all three handles. That meant the answer differed
between a human and CI, and the human got the worse half of it — with stdout inherited,
`output.stdout` came back empty and all 79 `run_output` call sites parsed an empty string. `shall
list -b apt` reported **609 packages piped and 1 under a terminal**. Nothing looked broken,
because what reached the screen was `dpkg-query`'s own output, which reads like a package list.
The same inheritance let `systemctl` decide a human was watching and start a pager, so read-only
`shall status` hung on a keypress and had to be killed, and printed 80, 640 and 83 lines across
three identical runs.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-27): Shall reads every command's output, and shows you what it read.**
Capture is a property of the call, never of the terminal Shall happens to have.

- **stdout and stderr are always captured, on every path, on every platform.** A parser that
  works in CI and not on your machine is worse than one that never works, because only one of
  the two gets reported.
- **stdin is the one stream a child may share, and only a mutation may share it.** `sudo` asks
  for a password on the terminal it was started from; a read has nothing to ask and nobody to
  answer it. `sudo` writes its prompt to `/dev/tty`, so the prompt still reaches the user with
  stderr captured.
- **A long mutation still shows its progress.** The bytes go both places: captured for the
  caller, mirrored to stderr as they arrive when a terminal is attached. Mirrored to stderr and
  never stdout — stdout carries Shall's own answer, and a manager's chatter interleaved with it
  is not parseable by whoever piped us.
- **Pagers are suppressed at the spawn, not left to the absence of a terminal.** Capturing
  removes the usual trigger, but `$PAGER`/`$SYSTEMD_PAGER` forces one anyway. The suppression
  goes in the one env map every spawn inherits, and `--no-pager` on every systemctl row besides.
- **No config key, no environment variable, no `--capture` flag.** One path. A switch here is a
  switch that turns the bug back on.

**The blind spot is the finding, not the defect.** 1,324 tests, four container lifecycles and
three OS builds all ran with pipes on every handle, so not one of them could observe any of
this. `tests/pty_tests.rs` runs the built binary under `script -qec` against a stub manager on
`PATH` and asserts that what Shall printed is what Shall parsed; it is a named step in CI's fast
half. Confirmed to fail against the previous behaviour before it was made to pass.

---

## U41

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-27, amended by the owner 2026-08-09.**

**In the tree today:** built in the same commit as this ruling. `Transaction` records a `Prior`
per node before the node runs, holds the user's `Config`, and its rollback calls
`guard::protection_of` before any compensating removal.

**U41 — What does a rollback do when the guard refuses one of its compensating removals?**
`transaction.rs` contained **zero** references to the guard. `guard::enforce` runs at plan time
over the planner's `Remove` nodes; a rollback's removals are issued at execution time and never
passed through it, so `protected_packages` and OS-essential protection did not apply to them —
in direct contradiction of the project's own rule that every path that removes calls the guard.
Wiring it in raises the question the wiring cannot answer: a refused compensating removal leaves
the transaction **partly applied**, and what Shall should then do is a product decision.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-27): the guard wins, and the rollback says what it could not undo.**

- **A protected package is not removed, by any path, for any reason.** A refusal is a refusal
  (V.26); it is not softened because the caller is a recovery path. V.64 already says these
  paths need the guard *more* than ordinary ones, because they run outside the plan the user
  read and usually when nobody is watching.
- **The partly-applied state is reported, never hidden.** `rollback` already returns an error
  naming every compensating action that failed; a guard refusal joins that list, by name, with
  the reason. The user is told exactly which package is still installed and why.
- **What Shall does not know, it does not delete.** A prior state the manager could not report
  is `Unknown`, and an `Unknown` is never read as "it was not there". The package stays and is
  named in the report. Guessing the other way deletes software this run never installed.
- **An upgrade is compensated by the old version, not by an uninstall.** `spec_is_missing`
  schedules an `Install` node for a package that is already present when a `@version=` or
  `@channel=` changes, so compensating every `Install` with `remove()` turned a failed upgrade
  into an uninstall. Rollback now reinstates the version the package was on; where the manager
  reported no version, it says so and leaves the package alone rather than removing it.
- **A rolled-back removal comes back pinned.** The reinstall carried `options: HashMap::new()`,
  so a package restored after a failed removal came back at whatever is newest — the declared
  pin silently gone.

**AMENDED (owner, 2026-08-09): one rule, in both directions — and the amendment `LX-3` made to
one arm without telling the register is now the rule for both.**

The 2026-07-27 ruling above said both arms compensate. `LX-3` (commit `e9a6ac4`) then changed the
*install* arm: `Prior::Absent` stopped being permission to remove, because "was not here before"
and "is not wanted now" are different facts and the manifest holds the second. That change is
right and shipped with a good comment. **What did not happen is anyone telling this entry**, so
the register recorded `U41` as `ANSWERED` unamended while the code had two arms following two
rules.

The rule is now one sentence: **rollback does not undo work that moved the machine toward the
declared state.**

- **Install arm** (unchanged from `LX-3`): an install that succeeded, of something the plan still
  intends to be present, is not failed work. It is the goal, reached early.
- **Removal arm** (new): a removal that succeeded, of something the plan still intends to be
  absent, is the same event from the other side. **The fact that authorised the removal —
  nothing declares this — is still true when the rollback fires, and it is knowable the same way
  it was knowable then.** Re-installing it hands the next sync the same work.

The owner's argument for the second half, in their words: *"we could have figured it out the same
way we know to delete it: it's not there"* — and *"besides you can rollback generations"*.

**What this costs, stated rather than buried:** a package the user had, that this run removed,
stays removed after a failed transaction. That is accepted because **generations and snapshots
are the durable put-it-back** and this is what they are for; a pre-sync restore point is taken on
every run and `shall history` reaches it.

**Two scopes are exempt, and each is an exception for a reason** —
`GuardScope::reconciles()` is exhaustive over all twelve:

- **`Rebuild`** splits one operation into two transactions so a `Remove` and an `Install` of the
  same package cannot race in one graph. Its removal phase is the first half of a reinstall of
  *declared* packages; leaving one of those removals in place is not convergence, it is a machine
  missing software it still declares.
- **`Remove`** is a person typing `shall uninstall`. It was not derived from a manifest, so a
  transaction that failed around it gives the package back.

**DEFERRED, not rejected: a durable `Prior` in the WAL.** The alternative to the removal-arm rule
is recording the removed package's *version* where a later process can read it, so a rollback
that outlives the run can reinstate exactly what was there. The WAL records the removal but not
the version. That is a real feature and it is not this one; when it exists, this ruling is worth
revisiting, because the reason to leave a removal in place is partly that putting it back
imprecisely is worse than not putting it back at all.

The mechanism is in `S60`; the rule is in **II.33**; the reason is in **V.164**.

## U42

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-27.**

**In the tree today:** built in the same commit as this ruling. `undo` is gone as a top-level
command; the gallery it opened is `shall snapshot restore`, beside `snapshot list` and
`snapshot prune`.

**U42 — Do the overlapping command clusters get consolidated?** A review counted 45 top-level
commands and named four clusters that overlap "without a clear rule for choosing", the headline
being that `status` and `prune` are two views of one drift computation and that
`undo`/`rollback`/`generation` are three vocabularies for restoring prior state.

**Measured against `shall --help` before the ruling, because the description was wrong.** The
surface is **62 entries, not 45**, and **ten of the thirteen commands named do not exist**:
`remove`, `prune`, `orphans`, `clean`, `unmanaged`, `status`, `doctor`, `migrate`, `clone`,
`generation`. Both headline examples are about commands that are not in the program. An audit
reads what is written; only running it reads what is there — and this one was never run.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-27): no consolidation. One rename, because the fault was a name.**

- **The removal cluster stays whole. It is not a cluster of synonyms** — each verb does
  something no other one does: `uninstall` a package; `remove-orphans` what the manager itself
  calls an orphan; `purge-unmanaged` everything Shall does not manage; `unmanage` forget a
  package but keep it installed; `reset` forget everything but keep everything installed;
  `clean-cache` archives and no packages. Collapsing any two removes a capability, and II.17's
  deletion list is the only approved removal.
- **The one real overlap was a name, not a redundancy.** Going back has two mechanisms —
  filesystem snapshots, and the git manifest history — and `undo` was the *snapshot* one while
  `history` (a TUI) and `rollback <ref>` (a CLI) are two interfaces onto the *manifest* one.
  A user wanting to undo their last sync reached for `undo` and got the wrong mechanism.
- **The gallery is now `shall snapshot restore`.** Its name says which of the two it is, and it
  sits with the other snapshot verbs. `undo` is not reassigned to anything: a word that meant
  the wrong thing does not improve by meaning a second thing.
- **`history` and `rollback` stay as they are.** A TUI and a flag-driven command over one
  mechanism are an interface pair, not two vocabularies.

**Also fixed under this ruling:** two user-facing messages pointed at `shall doctor`, which is
not a command. They say `shall check`.

## U43

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-27.**

**In the tree today:** built in the same commit as this ruling.

**U43 — How much does an ordinary run say about itself?** The default filter was `info` and
there are 256 `info!`/`warn!` call sites, so every run printed Shall narrating its own startup
above the answer the user asked for — `No state file found at …`, on **every** run, because a
read-only command never writes the registry it just reported missing.

Three things were true of the flags and only one of them was known: `--verbose` promised
"debug-level logging" and produced **none** (measured: 0 debug lines, against 5 for
`RUST_LOG=debug`), because the subscriber was built at `main.rs:41` and clap did not parse until
`:81`, so `cli.verbose` reached the executor and never reached the filter. `--quiet` did not
touch the log stream either.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-27): an ordinary run prints its answer and nothing else.**

- **Default `warn`.** What was on the `info` channel was commentary, not answer.
- **`-v` is info, `-vv` is debug, `-q` is errors only, and `-q` beats `-v`** when both are
  given — a run that says both meant the quiet half or it would not have typed it. `RUST_LOG`
  outranks all of it, unchanged.
- **The level is read from argv, not from the parsed `Cli`.** It has to be live before the shim
  hijack, and reading it after clap is exactly why `--verbose` did nothing.
- **A command's answer goes to stdout; only narration goes to the log.** This is the half that
  had to land first: `sync` reported `already up to date` at `info!` with nothing on stdout, so
  dropping the default without moving it would have made a no-op sync silent. Twenty-three
  lines moved — the whole of what `lock` and `unlock` report, `rebuild`'s skips and completion,
  `try`'s verdict, `config init`, `heal`'s repairs, the no-op sync and the no-op upgrade.

## K18

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** file writes are already atomic one file at a time — `write_atomic` stages
a temp file and renames it into place, so a `link:` target is never half-written. **Package
swaps are not atomic and mostly cannot be**, and the existing answer is K3's snapshot: one taken
before the first removal, reverted if the reinstall fails.

**K18 — Should Shall use a backend's own atomic mechanism where one exists (owner question,
2026-07-23)?** Asked as *"is there any way to make each swap atomic?"* The honest answer is that
it splits three ways and only the third is a decision:

- **Files: already atomic per file**, and not atomic across a set. A `link:` that writes forty
  files can be staged and renamed at the end to narrow the window, but no operating system
  offers a multi-file rename, so *narrower* is the whole of what is available.
- **Packages, on ordinary managers: no, and not by any effort of Shall's.** `apt`, `dnf`,
  `winget` and the rest expose no transaction to join. **What Shall already has is
  all-or-nothing in the outcome rather than in the instant** — K3's one snapshot before the
  first removal, reverted on a failed reinstall, with stop-and-name-what-is-missing where no
  snapshot provider exists. The window is real and visible; the end state is not half-done.
- **Packages, on managers that are genuinely transactional: yes, and this is the question.**
  `nix` is already a registered backend and its profile switch is a symlink flip — atomic, and
  rollback is another flip. `rpm-ostree` and `transactional-update` are the same shape. **Shall
  drives all of them today as if they were `apt`**, taking the snapshot-and-revert path over a
  mechanism that needs neither.

*Recommendation:* a backend may declare that it swaps atomically, and where it does, Shall uses
that instead of the snapshot path and says so in the plan — *"nix: atomic, no snapshot needed"*.
The value is not speed; it is that **the one honest sentence about a rebuild's risk changes per
backend**, and today Shall prints the cautious one everywhere. **This is not urgent** and nothing
is blocked on it — it is filed so that the answer stops being "no" when it is only "not yet".


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): make it an option.** Where a backend has its own atomic swap, a config option lets Shall use it; the default stays K3's pre-removal snapshot, because most package swaps cannot be atomic and a guarantee that only sometimes holds must be asked for, not assumed.

**RULED (2026-07-24): an option, added when a backend needs it.** Where a backend has its own atomic swap, a config option uses it; the default stays K3's pre-removal snapshot. NOT added as a dead key now: no backend currently exposes atomic swap, and this project holds that a preference that silently does nothing is worse than none (K4's own reasoning). The option lands with the first backend that can honour it — the ruling is what that backend's option will implement.

**REAFFIRMED (owner decision session 2026-07-26): stays parked, not part of this build.** The pre-real-machine build does NOT add a dead atomic-swap key. K18 lands with the first backend that actually exposes atomic swap, exactly as ruled above.

## T7

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** nothing. `app/run.rs:138` is the only place Shall is in a process's launch
path at all.

**T7 — Runtime injection of secrets into process memory: REOPENED for discussion (owner,
2026-07-23).** XII.2 ruled this out on 2026-07-23 and told the reader not to re-open it; **the
owner has since said the conversation stays open**, so the refusal is downgraded to a question
and XII.2 is amended to say so. The reasoning that produced the refusal is not withdrawn and is
the thing to argue with:

- **It asks Shall to be a supervisor.** For a credential never to touch disk, Shall must be in
  the launch path of every program that reads one. That is `systemd`'s `LoadCredential`, a
  `direnv`, or a secrets agent — three things that already exist and that Shall is not.
- **The half-measure is worse than either end.** Injecting only into children of `shall run`
  protects exactly the processes Shall starts and none of the ones that actually read
  `~/.npmrc`, while reading as though it protected both.
- **The bar the original ruling set:** a use case that lives entirely inside `shall run`. That is
  still the sharpest question to answer first — **what program, run how, needs the secret?**

*No recommendation.* The refusal was argued; what has not been heard is the case for it.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): keep it out — if it is hard, do not do it, and it is hard.** Runtime injection of secrets into process memory asks Shall to become a process supervisor (it must stay in the launch path of every process that reads the secret), which is a different and far larger thing than a package manager. The reopening was deliberate; the ruling is to leave XII.2's refusal standing. A secret still reaches a process the ordinary way — decrypted to a file the process reads, or an env var — never via Shall holding it in memory.

## D8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D8 — `when` inside an options body.** II.2 says a declaration's body is options, so
`github { when family == debian { … } }` is not legal today, and VIII.2's example wraps the whole
`github` block in a `when` instead. That works but gets repetitive across four families.
*Recommendation:* keep it illegal. The wrap form is uglier and does not need a new grammar rule,
and a new block kind here is how the grammar starts growing exceptions.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): keep it illegal.** `when` inside an options body stays disallowed. Wrapping the whole `github { … }` block in a `when` works and needs no new grammar rule; a new block kind here is how the grammar grows exceptions.

## D11

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D11 — The default order is detected, so a Shall upgrade can change it.** A machine with no
`formats` line that installs a `tarball` today could install a `deb` after an upgrade. The lock
protects an existing install; a fresh `shall lock` or a new machine does not. *Recommendation:*
treat the default order as versioned and say so in the changelog when it moves — or accept the
churn explicitly. Not decided.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes, version the default order.** The detected default artifact order carries a version constant; when it moves, the changelog says so. A machine with no `@formats=` line is then told, rather than silently installing a `deb` after an upgrade where it installed a `tarball` before.
---

## D12

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D12 — Network, rate limits, and offline.** Listing assets is a GitHub API call per repo.
Unauthenticated is 60/hour, which a repo with thirty `github:` lines exhausts on the second
`sync`. `SHALL_GITHUB_TOKEN` exists (II.1). *Recommendation:* resolve from `locks/github` without
any API call when the lock is present and the version is pinned; only `shall lock` and an
unpinned line hit the network. Needs deciding because it determines whether `sync` works on a
plane.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): resolve from the lock offline.** A pinned `github:` line resolves from `locks/github` with no API call; only `shall lock` and an unpinned line hit the network. `lock` is what freezes the resolved asset/version, so a later `sync` reproduces it without the 60/hour unauthenticated GitHub limit. This is what makes `sync` work offline and on a repo with many `github:` lines.

**Already built (`answered_locally` in `github.rs`).** A pinned line with a lock and matching on-disk assets resolves with no API call; only unpinned lines and `shall lock` hit GitHub. The ruling described existing behaviour — no new code needed.

## D13

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D13 — Changing a `channel` — refresh or reinstall?** `snap refresh --channel=edge` is not
`snap remove && snap install`, and moving `edge â†’ stable` is usually a downgrade. **A downgrade
is a removal-shaped event and the guard should see it.** *Recommendation:* refresh where the
backend supports it, and route the downgrade case through the plan and the guard like any other
destructive change.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): refresh, and route a downgrade through the guard.** Changing a `channel` refreshes in place where the backend supports it (`snap refresh --channel=`), and the downgrade case (`edge â†’ stable`) goes through the plan and the guard like any destructive change, because a downgrade is removal-shaped.

**RULED, NOT YET BUILT (2026-07-24).** Refresh where the backend supports it; route a channel downgrade through the plan and guard. Queued rather than built: it needs the planner to detect a *channel change* (query the installed channel, compare to the declared one — the planner currently checks version, not channel) AND a notion of channel ordering to tell a downgrade from an upgrade, both of which touch the change-detection core. Deferred to avoid a risky half-change there; the ruling is settled for when it is built.

## D14

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D14 — Does `why` explain the selection?** When `github:x/y` installs a `.tar.gz` on a machine
the user expected a `.deb` on, the answer lives in three places (line, `priority`, built-in
default) and `shall why` is the command that should say which one won. *Recommendation:* yes,
and it is a small amount of work only if the resolver keeps the reason rather than just the
result. Decide before the resolver is written, not after.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes.** `shall why` explains WHICH rule selected the artifact — the line's `@formats=`, `priority`, or the built-in default. The resolver must keep the reason, not just the result; decided before the artifact resolver is finalised so the reason is retained rather than reconstructed.

**BUILT, 2026-07-24.** The artifact lock records `selected_by` — which rule chose the file (`@asset=` pattern, `@formats=` line, or the built-in default). `shall why <pkg>` shows `selected: <asset> — chosen by <reason>`, read from the lock with no network re-selection.

## D17

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**D17 — Regex lines.** What `github:re:…@formats=` means when one pattern spans repos with
different asset sets is unspecified. *Probably:* the list applies to each match independently and
a match with no legal asset is the VIII.2 error, named per repo. Not decided, and low urgency —
`github:re:` is rare in practice.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): per-repo.** `github:re:…@formats=` applies the format list to each matched repo independently, and a repo with no matching asset is the ordinary VIII.2 error, named for that repo.

## W9

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**W9 — Interpolation outside `when`.** IX.5 says no. Record the boundary explicitly so the
answer is a decision rather than an omission, because the first `link:` request will arrive
quickly. *Recommendation:* stay narrow; reopen only with a use case that cannot be expressed as
two `when` arms.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): no.** No variable interpolation outside `when`. `$role` is tested in a condition, not substituted into a value; the same intent is two `when` arms. Reopen only with a case that cannot be.
---

## W10

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**W10 — Variables referencing variables.** `tier = $role-heavy`. Introduces ordering, cycles
(the same walk as `use` loops and `@requires` loops, II.7), and interpolation-inside-a-value,
which collides with W9. *Recommendation:* no, and the cycle machinery already existing is not a
reason to invite the problem.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): no.** Variables do not reference variables (`tier = $role-heavy`). It introduces ordering, cycles and interpolation-inside-a-value (which collides with W9), for a convenience two `when` arms already cover.

## K6

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** No group syntax anywhere in `src/`.

**K6 — Does Shall learn per-backend group syntax** (`@kde-desktop`, `pacman -S plasma`)? It
would make one line install a desktop. It also means `backend:name` has a third meaning on some
backends and not others, which is the kind of unification VIII.1 refused. *Recommendation:* no
for now; a `when family` block listing each distro's name is explicit, works today, and reads.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): no.** Shall does not learn per-backend group syntax (`@kde-desktop`, `pacman -S plasma`). It would give `backend:name` a third meaning on some backends and not others — the unification VIII.1 refused. A `when family` block naming each distro's package is explicit, works today, and reads. Not building.
---

## K12

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** No symlink handling in `app/locate.rs` or `config/settings.rs`.

**K12 — Is a symlink still supported for "my Shall files live in my dotfiles repo"?** With X.6's
settings file the symlink is no longer the only answer, but it costs nothing and some users will
reach for it first. *Recommendation:* yes, documented, with the settings file as the primary
mechanism.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes, keep the symlink, documented.** A user whose Shall files live in a dotfiles repo may symlink the config directory. The settings file (`shall path --set`) is the primary, first-class mechanism; the symlink costs nothing and some users reach for it first, so it stays supported and documented.
---

## N4

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**N4 — Is `default/incoming` a `firewall:` statement or a preference key?** As a statement it
inherits `when` and the plan; as a key in `preferences.toml` it is machine-local and invisible
to git. *Recommendation:* a statement — the default policy is the most important line in a
firewall and belongs in the repo with the rest.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): both, and the statement wins.** The default policy may be
written as a `firewall:` statement (in the repo, gated by `when`, visible in `plan`) or as a key
in `preferences.toml` (machine-local). Where both say something, **the line wins** — the same
precedence the owner set for N6, and for the same reason: the declaration is the thing you can
read, review and share, and a machine-local key silently overriding it would be the invisible
answer beating the visible one.

---

## N5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**N5 — What does removal restore?** X.4 ruled that a removed `setting:` resets to the schema
default rather than to the value the user had before Shall. *Recommendation:* the same answer,
for the same reason — restoring a per-rule prior state means keeping a per-rule store of it,
and "undeclared means the firewall's own default" is the shape every other statement's removal
already has. The cost is the same one X.4 recorded and it must be documented, not hidden.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): the firewall's own default, as recommended.** The same answer
X.4 gave for `setting:`, for the same reason — restoring a per-rule prior state means keeping a
per-rule store of it, and "undeclared means the firewall's own default" is the shape every other
removal already has. The cost is documented rather than hidden.

---

## N6

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**N6 — What happens when a config declares both `firewall:` lines and a `link:` to the
ruleset file?** *Recommendation:* an error at resolve time naming both files and lines, in the
class of II.7 rule 5. Two owners of one perimeter is the two-of-everything failure, and it
should be caught before any command runs, not discovered at 2am.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): warn, apply both, and the `firewall:` line wins.** The
recommendation was an error at resolve time; the owner's answer is softer and more useful — a
config that declares rules *and* links a ruleset file is doing something legible (a base file
plus specific overrides), so Shall warns that two things own the perimeter and lets the explicit
declaration take precedence where they disagree. **The warning is not optional**, because two
owners of one perimeter is still the two-of-everything failure; what changed is that it is
reported rather than refused.

---

## N7

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**N7 — Does `watch` revert firewall drift unattended, or only report it?** Everything else
`watch` reconciles is software; this reconciles reachability. *Recommendation:* report by
default, revert only under an explicit key, and never revert a rule that would trip N2.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): revert by default, and report instead only when the revert
would close the port carrying the session.** The recommendation had it the other way round. The
owner's answer is the more consistent one: drift is corrected everywhere else in this model, and
a firewall rule nobody declared is drift. The single exception is the one that cannot be undone
from the far end of an SSH connection — there Shall reports and leaves it, because an
un-reverted rule is a thing you fix tomorrow and a reverted one can be a machine you cannot
reach.

## N8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-10.**

**N8 — Is closing an undeclared port a removal, and does it count against `max_removals`?**
Recorded 2026-08-09 as BUILT, NEVER RULED, on the whole-repo review's finding that `N1`–`N7`
never ask it. **That finding was half wrong and worth recording as such**: the question had been
asked, under `Y20` — *"closing an undeclared port is one of them. Should it count against
`max_removals`?"* — and answered by the owner the same day. It was searched for in the `N`
series, and it was living in the `Y` series, because it arrived through the removal-guard work
rather than through the firewall work. A register indexed by where a question came from is a
register you can search correctly and still miss.

So the substance of `N8` was ruled by `Y20` on 2026-08-09 (**yes, it is a removal; yes, it
counts; against its own ceiling**), and what remained was the part `Y20` did not ask: ports were
lumped in with resource teardowns, and nothing bounded a command's changes as a whole.

**RULED 2026-08-10 (owner): a ceiling per category, and a ceiling over all of them.** The owner's
words: *"you should be able to set a max (per category and all in all) in the config"*, and then
*"there is a max per all changes also — including install, uninstall, etc."*

What is binding:

1. **`max_port_closures` is new**, default 20, and covers a port closed because no `firewall:`
   line declares it. `max_extra_removals` no longer does. Reachability is its own axis: the run
   that first declares a perimeter closes far more ports than a settled machine ever tears down
   resources, and it must not spend a teardown allowance to do it.
2. **`max_total_changes` is new**, default **0 (off)**, and counts **everything one command
   changes** — installs and upgrades, package removals, resource teardowns, resources written,
   ports opened and ports closed. Three ceilings of twenty permit fifty-seven changes; this is
   the number that objects to fifty-seven.
3. **It is off by default.** A total is a statement about how much churn a particular machine
   tolerates, which Shall does not know. Any non-zero default would refuse syncs that ran
   yesterday on machines that never asked, and would be turned off before it caught anything.
4. **Every gate answers the total, including the ones that only add.** `enforce_additions` has no
   ceiling of its own and refuses nothing on its own account; it exists so that a total is a
   total rather than a removal ceiling with a longer name.
5. **Both mass flags answer the total** — it is made of installs and removals both — and no third
   flag is added. `--allow-mass-install` answers the total and the install count and **no removal
   count**: the flag that means *install* that many must never also mean *remove* that many.
6. **A refusal names every ceiling it hit**, not the first. A set can be over its own number and
   over the total at once, and naming one sends the reader to raise it and meet the other.

**The cost this ruling accepts, unchanged from `Y20`:** a machine with forty ports open and one
`firewall:22/tcp` line still refuses on its first sync — now at `max_port_closures`. Forty ports
closing at once is the shape a ceiling exists to interrupt, and the answer is one flag.

The mechanism is in `S79`; the rule is in **II.28**; the reason is in **V.159**.

## T3

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**T3 — What does a missing hardware token look like?** The plugin may prompt on a terminal
nobody is watching. *Recommendation:* a timeout, and a message naming the token and the
identity file rather than passing the plugin's own text through.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): timeout, and a message Shall owns.** A `@decrypt` whose hardware token is absent times out rather than hanging on the plugin's own prompt, and Shall names the token and the identity file rather than passing the plugin's text through.
---

## T4

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**T4 — May an unattended `watch` tick decrypt?** A touch-required key turns a background
reconcile into a silent block. *Recommendation:* `watch` skips `@decrypt` lines whose identity
is a plugin stub and says so once, rather than hanging.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): skip and say so once.** An unattended `watch` tick skips a `@decrypt` line whose identity is a touch-required plugin stub, and says so a single time, rather than blocking the whole reconcile waiting for a human who is not there.

## U2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U2 — Is a custom backend a full peer of a built-in?** Repos, orphans, dependency queries and
`is_essential` are `ManagerConfig` fields `CustomBackendDef` does not expose.
*Recommendation:* expose them as optional keys, absent meaning *this backend cannot answer
that* — the `ManualListing` distinction already made for exactly this reason: "not configured"
must not be read as "the answer is none".


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): first-class.** A custom backend is a full peer of a built-in. The fields a built-in has and `CustomBackendDef` did not — repositories, orphan listing, dependency queries, OS-essential — are exposed as optional keys, absent meaning *this backend cannot answer that*, never *the answer is none* (the `ManualListing` distinction, generalised). This is the onboarder becoming a true equal, which is the whole 'it can drive anything' thesis.
---

## U4

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U4 — Is `exec:` a licence to put a shell script where a backend belongs?** The onboarder is
the better answer for anything that installs software, and `exec:` should not become the way
people avoid writing eight lines of TOML. *Recommendation:* document the boundary in the
readme, and treat repeated `exec:` lines that install things as a sign the onboarder needs a
missing field (U2), not as usage to encourage.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): document the boundary.** `exec:` is for actions with no inverse, not for installing software — an `exec:` that installs is a one-way door (deleting the line does not undo it). The onboarder is the answer for anything installable: it gives a noun, which removes/lists/locks. The README's `exec:` section now says so and links the onboarder.

**AMENDED by U33 (owner, 2026-07-26): the categorical refusal is lifted.** `exec:` may install
software and do anything, gated behind an explicit config key (off by default). The boundary this
entry drew is now a *recommendation*, not a prohibition: the onboarder is still the **better** path
for anything installable (a noun that removes/lists/locks), and the README says so, but `exec:` is
no longer forbidden from installing when the key is on. Removal is still governed by U3 — an
installing `exec:` has no automatic inverse without `@undo=`.

## U6

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U6 — Does this document mark its Linux-only guarantees?** The pre-sync snapshot, `rebuild`'s
revert and `rollback`'s safety net all assume a provider that exists only on Linux
filesystems. *Recommendation:* yes, immediately and independently of whether VSS or APFS is
ever adapted — an unqualified promise that silently does not hold on two of three platforms is
P3's failure in prose form.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes.** The Linux-only guarantees — the pre-sync snapshot, `rebuild`'s revert, `rollback`'s safety net — are marked as such in the docs, independently of whether VSS or APFS is ever adapted. An unqualified promise that silently does not hold on two of three platforms is P3's silent-wrongness in prose.

## U7

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U7 — Is a health check per-package or per-sync?** Per-package answers "did *this* upgrade
break it" and is precise; per-sync catches the breakage a package cannot see (the boot, the
network). *Recommendation:* both, and they are not alternatives — `@health=` on a line, plus a
`health` list in `preferences.toml` for the machine-wide checks, with the same revert path.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): both, as recommended.** `@health=` on a line answers *did this
upgrade break this*, and a machine-wide `health` list in `preferences.toml` catches what a
package cannot see — the boot, the network, the thing two packages away. They are not
alternatives and share one revert path.

**BUILT, 2026-07-24 (7f).** `@health=` is a package option key and a `health = [...]` list is a
`preferences.toml` key. Both are collected in one place and share one revert path. A declared
check with no snapshot provider refuses **before** the change (V.65). `@check=`, an unreachable
branch reading an option key the grammar never accepted, was deleted in the same commit.

---

## U8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U8 — Is the removal preview a flag or a verb?** *Recommendation:* a flag on the commands that
already compute it. A new verb for an existing computation is how this repo got two of
everything.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): a flag, not a verb.** The removal preview already exists as `check drift` and `--dry-run`; the decision is not to add back an `orphans`/`prune` verb. The stale "prune would remove" message was corrected to name `sync`.
---

## U10

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24, and neither option was taken.**

**U10 — Where does a backend's bootstrap live?** In `priority`, beside the backend it obtains,
or in `custom_backends.toml`, beside the definition. *Recommendation:* `priority` — it is the
file that already decides which backends this machine uses, and a custom backend's definition is
about *how to drive* a manager, not *how to get* one. The two files stay one-question-each.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): a third file — and the other two move to join it.** *"It should be
a separate file, all 3 should be in the shareable config part, and all should be in the same
folder."* The recommendation's own reasoning (one question per file) was right and was applied
one step further than it had been: **how to get a manager** is a third question, so it is a third
file, and the three sit together because they are one subject — what you have taught this Shall.

```
adapters/backends.toml    how to drive a package manager Shall does not ship   (XIII.2)
adapters/settings.toml    how to read and write a settings store               (K17)
adapters/bootstrap.toml   how to obtain a manager this machine does not have   (7c)
```

- **In the config repo**, so a definition travels with the configuration that needs it — the
  point 7a/U1 established, now applying to all three.
- **Each file is approved separately** through II.12's ledger (`adapters:<filename>`), because
  they carry different argv: approving the backends you added is not a review of the settings
  adapters. One identity per *file*, not per definition, so an edit that **adds** a definition
  still invalidates the approval.
- **The K17 arrangement is superseded**: settings adapters shared `custom_backends.toml` because
  at the time that was where repo-supplied definitions lived. They have their own file now.
- **The folder name is `adapters/`** — an implementing call, not a ruling: it is the word the
  spec already uses for settings stores (K17), and a backend definition adapts a CLI the same
  way. Bootstrap sits with them because it answers a question about the same subject.
- **NO LEGACY:** the old `custom_backends.toml` path is deleted, not read as a fallback.

## U11

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24, and generalised past the question that was asked.**

**U11 — Does `watch` imply `--locked`?** An unattended reconcile that silently accepts a new
upstream version is the least supervised place for a version to change. *Recommendation:* yes by
default, overridable by a key — a machine reconciling itself at 3am should be converging to what
was decided, not to what was published.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): it is not a `watch` question. `sync` itself defaults to the
recorded version, with an explicit `--upgrade` to move forward — and `watch`, being `sync` with
nobody watching, inherits that rather than being special-cased.** The owner's words: *"it should
be the same as sync, which if sync does not do this, it needs fixing."*

**It did need fixing, and this was a live defect.** `sync` defaulted to `locked: false` and
`watch` hard-coded it, so `locks/versions.json` was read *only* under `sync --locked`. A machine
rebuilt from a config therefore installed whatever upstream had published that morning, not the
version the lock recorded — which is the reproducibility claim the lock exists to make.

**Three modes now, and the middle one is new:**

| | a recorded version | nothing recorded | a pin that disagrees |
|---|---|---|---|
| **default** | wins | resolves freely | **the line wins** |
| `--upgrade` | ignored | resolves freely | the line wins |
| `--locked` | wins | **error** | **error** |

- **Nothing recorded is not an error by default.** That is the ordinary state of a machine that
  has never run `shall lock`, and making it fatal would mean no config works until it is locked.
  Strict `--locked` keeps that refusal, because there a missing entry is a gap in the
  reproduction rather than a detail.
- **A hand-written `@version=` beats the lock outside strict mode.** A version you typed is a
  decision; the lock is a record of one. Under `--locked` the same disagreement is an error,
  because a reproduction that silently picks one of two answers has reproduced neither.
- **`shall lock` stays the deliberate act** that records versions, exactly as it is the
  deliberate act that approves a hook or an `exec:` script.

## U12

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U12 — Does `try` reuse the Phase 6 images, or build from a base the config names?** Reusing
them is nearly free and covers debian/alpine/arch today; a config-named base is what a user with
an unusual host actually needs. *Recommendation:* start with the Phase 6 images, and treat a
config-named base as the second step rather than the blocker — the value is in the rehearsal
existing at all.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): reuse the Phase 6 images to start.** debian/alpine/arch are
already built and cover most hosts; a config-named base is the second step, not the blocker. The
value is the rehearsal existing at all.

## U13

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U13 — Does `@runs=always` exist?** It is the escape hatch inside the escape hatch, and every
such key eventually becomes the default somebody copies. *Recommendation:* yes, but it prints
what it is doing on every sync — a line that runs unconditionally must be visible in the run it
made non-idempotent, or the next person debugging a slow sync has no thread to pull.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes.** `@runs=always` exists and prints a line naming itself on
every sync (`runs=always — every sync`), so a non-idempotent line is visible in the run it made
non-idempotent. Once is the default; `@runs=N` runs a set number of times (already built as the
ceiling). A count may also be expressed by gating `@runs=always` with a `when` — the owner's
preferred spelling — which the existing `when` machinery already supports.
---

## U15

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U15 — Where do Shall-level event hooks live, and are they per-machine?** `preferences.toml` is
machine-local, so `after_sync` on the laptop is invisible to the desktop. That is right for a
notification hook and wrong for a policy one. *Recommendation:* `preferences.toml` first —
machine-local behaviour is the honest default for something that talks to *this* machine's
Slack — and revisit only when a real case wants a fleet-wide event.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): both locations, not one.** A hook may live in
`preferences.toml` (machine-local — the notification that talks to *this* machine's Slack) or in
the config repo (the policy every machine should run). The recommendation offered only the first;
the owner's answer is that the choice belongs to the user, because the two kinds of hook are
genuinely different and forcing them into one file makes one of them wrong.

**They are additive, not overriding.** A repo hook and a machine hook for the same event both
run — the repo's because every machine should, this machine's because it is this machine. A
precedence rule would mean adding a local notification silently disables the shared policy, which
is the quiet failure this model exists to avoid.

**BUILT, 2026-07-24 (7j).** Both locations: `hooks/<event>` in the config repo and
`[hooks.<event>]` in `preferences.toml`. Both fire, repo first, with separate ledger identities
so approving the shared policy never rubber-stamps the local file. Events are `after_sync`,
`on_drift`, `on_guard_refusal`; a failing hook warns and does not fail the sync.

## U16

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**Still open, and now reachable — 2026-07-23.** `binary` exists (7a), and a path in it is
**refused** with a message saying why: this is the status quo preserved, not an answer. Allowing
it later is additive; allowing it now would decide the question in code.

**U16 — Does the field split (XIII.12) allow an absolute path as `binary`?** A prefix that runs
`/opt/vendor/thing` is more useful and is also a definition that only works on one machine.
*Recommendation:* allow it, resolve `~`, and have `doctor` report a custom backend whose binary
is missing — the failure should be a named diagnosis, not an unknown-backend error three layers
away.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes.** A custom backend's `binary` may be an absolute path; a
leading `~` is expanded. A definition naming a path that is not on this machine is not refused
at load — it is a named diagnosis in `check health` ("`/opt/vendor/thing` does not exist or is
not executable"), where the fix is obvious. Whitespace and emptiness are still refused, being a
malformed value rather than a path.

## U17

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U17 — Is `shall eval`'s output versioned from the first release?** *Recommendation:* yes, a
top-level schema version, decided before anything consumes it. P2 says there is no legacy to
carry, and this is the one output that will acquire consumers Shall cannot see.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes.** `shall eval` carries a top-level schema version from its
first release. It is the one output that will acquire consumers Shall cannot see, and P2 leaves
no legacy to carry — so the version is free now and impossible later.

**BUILT, 2026-07-24 (7k).** `shall eval` prints the resolved state as JSON with a top-level
`schema`. It takes no lock and touches no backend. Sources are repo-relative with forward
slashes so two machines' evaluations diff cleanly.

---

## U18

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U18 — Are grouped backends with per-group priority worth building at all?** The workaround —
write the prefix — already works, and what it costs is the portability a bare name exists for.
*Recommendation:* build it only with the invariant attached: **a bare name still resolves once
per machine**, and two modules that would resolve the same name through different groups is an
error naming both, which is II.7 rule 5 reached by a new road rather than a new rule. Without
that, this feature ships two `ripgrep` binaries fighting over `$PATH` — the failure
`app/conflicts.rs` already exists to catch.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): build it — it is only a shortcut.** A group is a NAME for a backend chain, so instead of `apt,dnf,cargo:ripgrep` on every line you define `tools = apt, dnf, cargo` in a `groups` file and write `tools:ripgrep`. It expands to exactly that chain in the one parser (V), inheriting the chain's meaning and safety with nothing added — `priority` still exists, a bare name still resolves through it. **Groups nest** (owner): a member may be another group, flattened to terminal backends at load, and a cycle is refused like a `use` loop. This is NOT the per-module-priority design the recommendation feared — that footgun does not apply to a chain alias. BUILT the same day: `src/model/groups.rs`, `Vocab::with_groups`, grammar expansion, verified on the binary (`all = cargo, winmgrs` / `winmgrs = scoop, winget` → `all:rg` resolves).
---

## U20

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24 (build only if thin AND easy; deferred).**

**U20 — Is a language server wanted, and is it allowed to be a second implementation?** *This is
the whole question, not the feature.* *Recommendation:* wanted, but only as a thin front end
over the same parser and resolver the binary uses — the moment it re-implements the grammar it
becomes the second implementation this rewrite exists to end, and it will disagree with the
first within a release. If it cannot be thin, do not build it.


**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes, but only if very easy — and it is not, yet.** A language server is a stdio JSON-RPC protocol server (document sync, diagnostic ranges, the LSP handshake); even diagnostics-only is a few hundred lines and a protocol, which is not "very easy" and not worth a half-implementation. **Deferred.** The editor-diagnostic hook it would provide already exists in a thinner form: `shall check config` prints `file:line: message` from the same parser the binary uses, which efm-langserver / null-ls / ALE consume directly. Its one limit is that it stops at the first error rather than collecting all — the natural first step if this is ever picked up, and cheaper than an LSP.

## U21

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**In the tree today:** No exit-code table; `main.rs:33` is the only `process::exit` and it is `0`.

**U21 — Is the exit-code table settled once, up front?** *Recommendation:* yes — 0 converged, 1
Shall failed, 2 differences found, 3 refused by the guard — decided in one place before
`--locked`, `try` and `check` are written. An exit code decided per command is a convention no
script can rely on, and the separation that matters is 3: a guard refusal is neither a failure
nor a difference.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): yes — 0 converged, 1 Shall failed, 2 differences found, 3 refused
by the guard.** Decided in one place before the commands that use it. **BUILT the same day**
(`core::exit`), and it exposed a real gap: the guard refused through `Error::Other`, so a refusal
was indistinguishable from a crash and no script could avoid retrying one. It has its own
`Error::Refused` now, `check` returns `Error::Differences`, and one mapping point in `main`
turns both into codes. Verified on the binary: findings â†’ 2, clean â†’ 0, bad argument â†’ 1.

## U25

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-24.**

**U25 — One tree or several?** Several (`dotfiles:./dotfiles-work` under a `when`) composes
with the model already and costs nothing; one is simpler to explain. *Recommendation:* several,
because the statement takes a path anyway and forbidding a second one would be a rule with no
mechanism behind it — but two trees that would link the same destination is an error naming
both, which is II.7 rule 5 reached by a new road rather than a new rule.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-24): several, as recommended.** The statement takes a path, so
forbidding a second one would be a rule with no mechanism behind it. Two trees that would link
the same destination is an error naming both — II.7 rule 5 reached by a new road, not a new
rule.

# Answered earlier — the first three rounds

## T6

**Status: ANSWERED — fully ruled (blocking half 2026-07-23; both sub-questions 2026-07-26).**

**In the tree today:** `backup_once` (`link.rs:172`) has **no opt-out and no bound of any kind
beyond one-per-target.** It never clobbers an existing backup, so a target accumulates exactly
one — and `remove` (`link.rs:369`) does not delete or restore it, so that one is permanent.

**T6 — There must be a way to opt out of the backup, or to limit how many accumulate (owner
request, 2026-07-23).** Raised while ruling T1, and **it is not a secrets question** — every
`link:` managed-content write calls `backup_once`, so this governs ordinary config files too.
Four things need answering and they are not the same question:

1. **The opt-out's shape.** A per-line `@backup=no` says it where the exception is, at the cost
   of an option key on every `link:` line. A `preferences.toml` key says it once for the machine
   and cannot express *"this one file, not the others"*. Both is two mechanisms for one question.
2. **What "limit amounts" means, given it is already one per target.** The accumulation is across
   *targets*, not within one — forty linked files means up to forty orphaned backups. So the
   candidates are an age (delete a backup older than N days), a command that lists and clears
   them, or a rule tying the backup's life to the declaration's.
3. **Does removing the `link:` line remove the backup, restore it, or leave it?** Today: leave
   it, and that is almost certainly wrong. **Restoring it is the shape every other extra
   already has** — `extras_lock` undoes what a declaration did — and it is the answer that makes
   the backup a rollback rather than a leak.
4. **Is there a command to see them at all?** They are invisible to `check` because they are not
   managed, which means the one thing standing between a user and forty stale plaintexts is
   remembering the file-naming convention.

*Recommendation:* per-line `@backup=no` **and** removal restoring the backup (3), which together
answer 1 and 2 without a retention policy: a backup that is put back when the declaration goes
does not accumulate, and the line that wants no backup says so. A `shall` command to list orphaned
backups then covers the case where the user deleted the line before this existed.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): removing the declaration restores the backup.** Sub-question 3 is
answered, and it answers 2 with it: a backup that is **put back** when the line goes cannot
accumulate, so no retention policy, no age, and no cleanup command are needed for the ordinary
case. `remove` (`link.rs:369`) currently drops the target and orphans `<target>.shall-backup`
forever; it will instead restore the original and delete the backup, which is the shape
`extras_lock` already has for every other extra — **a declaration undoes what it did.**

**This shrinks T1.** Decrypt mode still never backs up, but the reason is now narrower and the
fix smaller: without restore-on-removal a suppressed backup would have been a special case, and
with it the general path is already safe.

**Still owed, and deliberately not ruled here:** sub-question 1, the opt-out's spelling
(`@backup=no` on the line, a machine-wide key, or both), and sub-question 4, whether any command
lists backups orphaned by the versions of Shall that shipped before this ruling. Both are
smaller once restore-on-removal exists, and neither blocks it.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-26): both sub-questions closed. T6 is fully answered.**

- **Sub-question 1 — the opt-out is per-line `@backup=no`.** It states the exception exactly where
  the exception is (this file, not the machine), and restore-on-removal already killed the pile-up
  a machine-wide key would have been for — so a single mechanism, not two, and no "which one wins"
  question. A machine-wide key is not added.
- **Sub-question 4 — nothing is owed.** NO LEGACY: Shall has no real users, so there are no
  pre-ruling orphaned backups in the wild to sweep, and no cleanup command is built. If stray-
  backup *visibility* is ever wanted it belongs as a line in `check`, never a new verb (U8) — but
  it is not built now, because there is nothing to see.

## N1

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Nothing. No firewall code exists in `src/`.

**N1 — Is the declared perimeter exclusive?** *This is the whole feature.* Additive means the
lines say "these rules exist" and anything else a human added survives. Exclusive means they say
"these rules and no others", and an undeclared rule is drift to be removed — which is what
"instantly detecting and purging any unauthorised out-of-band changes" asks for, and is the only
version that makes the perimeter a fact rather than a floor. It is also the version that deletes
the rule someone added for a reason nobody wrote down. *Recommendation:* exclusive, because an
additive firewall answers no question worth asking, **but only with N2 answered and only behind
`purge-unmanaged`'s existing opt-in shape** (II.11) rather than on by default in `sync`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): the firewall does not get its own answer. `sync` is additive and
`purge-unmanaged` is exclusive, as always.**

The question was framed as a choice about firewalls and it is not one — **it is the model's
existing split, applied to a new backend**, and the right answer to *"is my declaration
exclusive?"* is the same for every backend that ever asks it. The three cases, spelled out
because the framing hid that they were already decided:

| the rule | who made it | `sync` | `purge-unmanaged` |
|---|---|---|---|
| declared, and present | you, in a file | left alone | left alone |
| declared once, now undeclared | Shall, and the declaration is gone | **removed** — it is in the extras ledger | removed |
| never declared, added out of band | a human at 2am | **left alone** | **removed** |

**This deletes the special shape the recommendation proposed.** There is no "exclusive mode
behind an opt-in": `purge-unmanaged` *is* the opt-in, it already exists, and inventing a
firewall-shaped version of it would have been a second implementation of the one question this
model answers once.

**Recorded in II.11, with its reason in V.63**, because it is a general rule about the two
commands and not a fact about firewalls — and because the question could only be asked in the
first place by someone who could not find it written down.

**It also narrows N7.** "Does `watch` revert firewall drift" no longer means "does it purge
rules nobody declared" — it cannot, that is `purge-unmanaged`'s job now. It means only: when a
rule **Shall owns** is changed out of band, does an unattended tick put it back? That is a
smaller question and a sharper one, because putting a rule back can close a port somebody opened
at 2am to fix something, with nobody there to read about it (N2).

---

## N2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Nothing. No firewall code exists in `src/`.

**N2 — What does Shall do when the change would close the session it is running over?** A
confirmation prompt cannot work: the prompt travels over the connection the change severs.
*Recommendation:* refuse. Detect the port of the controlling connection, and refuse any plan
that would deny it, naming the port and the rule — overridable only by a flag that says the
user has console access. Building this feature without this check is building the lockout.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): refuse, and detect the port rather than asking.** A confirmation
cannot work — the prompt travels over the connection the change severs. Shall detects the port
carrying the controlling connection and refuses any plan that would deny it, naming the port and
the rule that would close it. The only override is a flag asserting console access.

**This check binds every path that can close a port, not just `sync`.** N1's ruling means
`purge-unmanaged` can close one, and a `watch` tick reconciling a rule Shall owns can close one
while nobody is watching — **which is the more dangerous of the two, because nobody is there to
read the refusal.** A check on one command is a check on nothing; this is II.10's rule about the
guard, reached by a new road.

---

## N3

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Nothing. No firewall code exists in `src/`.

**N3 — Which adapters ship, and does one adapter justify the backend?** XI.2 says the backend
earns its place across firewalls and not within one. *Recommendation:* it is not worth starting
below two adapters plus Windows; if only `ufw` is in reach, document the `link:` pair and close
this part.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): build it — and the reason the answer changed is K17.**

The entry's own position was that below two adapters plus Windows the honest recommendation is
to build nothing and document the `link:`+`service:` pair instead. **That argument was entirely
about cost per adapter, and K17 changed the cost.** Adapters are a declarable table with the
built-ins as rows in it, so five firewalls are five rows rather than five Rust backends, and
XIII.12's field split already showed `firewall:22/tcp` working from six lines of TOML.

**Windows Defender Firewall is in the first set**, not a later platform phase — P7, and the
owner's daily machine. A Linux adapter (`ufw` or `firewalld`) is the other.

**What does not change is XI.2's honesty about the alternative.** The `link:`+`service:` pair
still works and is still the right answer for someone with one machine and one firewall; what
the backend buys is one spelling across several, per-rule drift instead of per-file, and
read-before-write.

---

## T1

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** **Still live.** `link.rs:319` calls `backup_once` on the managed-content write path that mode D uses; `:172` is the copy. The 0600 at `:285` is applied to the target only.

**T1 — `backup_once` copies the previous secret to a world-readable file.** `link.rs:319` and
`:154` run for every managed-content write, including mode D: if the target already holds a
secret, Shall copies it to `<target>.shall-backup` before overwriting — with default umask
permissions, and with no `.shall-backup` in any ignore file. The 0600 at `:285` is applied to the
target only. *Recommendation:* mode D never backs up. The point of `backup_once` is that a user
is not silently robbed of a config file they hand-wrote; a secret Shall itself wrote a moment ago
is not that, and the backup is a plaintext credential in a predictable path nobody will think to
delete. **This is a defect in shipped code, not a design question — but it is recorded here
rather than fixed silently, per rule 4.**

**CORRECTED 2026-07-23, before the ruling — two of the three facts above are false, and the real
defect is worse than the one recorded.** Read from the code rather than from the sentence:

- **The backup is not written under the default umask.** `link.rs:203` uses `tokio::fs::copy`,
  which copies the source file's permission bits. A `0600` original produces a `0600` backup.
- **`.shall-backup` is not absent from every ignore file.** `core/git.rs:169` writes
  `*.shall-backup` into the config repo's `.gitignore` at `shall git init`. It only covers
  backups that land *inside* the repo, which is T2's case, but the claim as written is wrong.
- **What is actually true, and was not recorded: nothing ever removes the backup.** `remove`
  (`link.rs:369`) deletes the target and leaves `<target>.shall-backup` untouched, and
  `backup_once` refuses to clobber an existing one. So a decrypted credential's predecessor
  **survives the declaration being deleted, and survives forever.** No command lists them, no
  command cleans them, and the file is invisible to `check` because it is not managed.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): decrypt mode never backs up.** The point of `backup_once` is that a
user is not silently robbed of a config file they hand-wrote. A secret is not that, and a
plaintext credential in a predictable path that nothing will ever delete is a worse outcome than
the one the backup exists to prevent.

---

## T2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** **Still live.** Nothing in `link.rs` compares the resolved `@target=` against the config root.

**T2 — Nothing stops `@target=` from pointing back into the config repo.** A
`link:./secrets/token.age@target=./secrets/token@decrypt=age` writes the plaintext next to the
ciphertext, inside git, and the next `sync` commits it. *Recommendation:* refuse a `@target=`
that resolves inside the config root when `@decrypt` is set — the check is cheap, the failure is
unrecoverable (a secret in git history is a rotated secret), and X.5's promise that a backup is
safe to hand to someone depends on it holding.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): refuse a `@target=` that resolves inside the config root when
`@decrypt` is set.** The check is cheap and the failure it prevents is unrecoverable — a secret
in git history is a rotated secret. X.5's promise that a `bundle` is safe to hand to someone
depends on this holding, and `core/git.rs:169`'s `*.shall-backup` ignore line does not cover it:
the plaintext target is not named `.shall-backup`.

---

## T5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**T5 — Is the plaintext 0600 at creation, or after?** Today `write_atomic` creates under the
umask and `set_permissions` follows (`link.rs:285-292`). The window is small and local, and on
Windows there is no restriction at all. *Recommendation:* create restricted rather than
chmod after, and on Windows either set an ACL or say plainly in the docs that mode D gives the
file no special protection there — the second is acceptable, silence is not.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): create restricted, and Windows gets a real answer rather than
silence.** The plaintext is created with its final permissions rather than created under the
umask and chmod'd afterwards.

**On Windows the file gets an ACL or the documentation says plainly that it does not.** Silence
is not acceptable — this is the owner's daily platform, and an unqualified *"the plaintext is
0600"* that holds on one of three platforms is P3's failure written as prose.

---

## K17

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `backends/setting.rs` has a closed `enum SettingStore` with two variants,
`GSettings` and `None`. Adding a store means adding a variant, which means shipping a release.

**K17 — How does `setting:` reach a store nobody has written an adapter for?** Raised by K7's
2026-07-23 ruling, which says *everywhere* rather than naming a closed set. Every adapter is the
same three operations — read a key, write a key, reset a key to its default — and for most stores
each is one command with the key interpolated into it. That is exactly the shape
`custom_backends.toml` already describes for package managers (XIII.2, XIII.12): argv from a
table, output read by a declared parser.

- **A closed enum, grown per release.** Simplest, and it is today's code. It means the machine
  running the store Shall has not heard of gets a refusal until a Shall release reaches it, which
  is the machine most likely to be running something unusual in the first place.
- **A declarable adapter, the way custom backends already are.** Three commands and a value
  encoding in a table, so a COSMIC or a Hyprland or a thing not invented yet is six lines rather
  than a pull request. It costs what U1 costs — a definition that a shared repo can execute is
  II.12's supply-chain surface and must inherit the hook trust model, not a new one.
- **Both, with the built-ins as data too**, so there is one code path rather than a fast one and
  a slow one. **Two of everything is how this repo got into trouble**, and an enum plus a table
  is exactly two.

*Recommendation:* the third. The built-in adapters become rows in the same table the user can
add a row to, `setting:` reads that table and nothing else, and the refusal for an unadapted
store stays exactly as it is. **Decide before the registry adapter (7e) is written** — it is the
second adapter, and the second one is where the shape is set.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): a lot of stores, and adding one is a plugin, not a release.** The
third option — the built-in adapters become rows in the same table a user can add a row to,
`setting:` reads that table and nothing else. **One code path, not a compiled fast one and a
declared slow one**, because an enum plus a table is two of everything with a new name.

- **`gsettings` stops being special.** It becomes a row like the rest, which is the only way the
  built-ins stay honest: an adapter mechanism that the built-ins bypass is a mechanism nobody has
  actually tested.
- **The refusal survives.** A store with no row makes every `setting:` line an error naming it.
  That is what lets adapters land one at a time and what keeps a key from being silently
  unapplied.
- **It inherits the hook trust model, not a new one.** An adapter definition is argv that a
  shared config repo can execute, which is II.12's supply-chain surface — the same consequence
  U1 carries for custom backends, and it must be answered the same way rather than twice.

**BUILT 2026-07-23, as ruled.** `enum SettingStore` is deleted. An adapter is a
`[[setting_store]]` row — `name`, `detect` (the command whose presence means the machine runs
this store), optional `os`, and the `read`/`write`/`reset` argv with `{schema}`, `{key}` and
`{value}` substituted. `gsettings` is a row in `src/backends/setting_stores.toml`, **parsed by
the same loader a user's row goes through**, so the shipped adapter cannot drift into a
privileged path nobody has tested.

**The trust answer is literally the same one, not the same shape.** User rows live in the config
repo's `custom_backends.toml` — the file 7a moved and put under the hook ledger — and both
readers go through one `read_approved_definitions`. One file, one approval, one refusal message,
and no way to add a third kind of definition that quietly skips the check. The alternative
(`setting_stores.toml` as its own file) would have been a second loader and a second ledger
entry for the identical question.

**A row that cannot be read is refused rather than half-used.** X.4's read-before-write is what
makes `setting:` a declaration instead of a command that runs every sync, so an adapter with no
`read` is not a slow adapter — it is not an adapter. Same for a missing `reset`: removing the
declaration would silently do nothing.

**The refusal now names what Shall looked for**, so the machine running the unlisted store learns
what to write a row about rather than only that it failed.

## D2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `backends/artifact/select.rs:260` (`classify_format`) and `platform.rs:96` (`classify`). The entry's own caveat — *"needs testing against real releases before it is a rule"* — is still unmet.

**D2 — How is a format recognised from an asset filename?** There is no metadata on a GitHub
asset saying "this is a tarball" — only a filename, and release naming is a free-for-all
(`fd-v10.2.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, `fd_10.2.0_amd64.deb`, `fd-linux`, `fd`). Pure
extension matching fails on `binary`, which has no extension by definition. *Recommendation:*
extension match for everything that has one, and `binary` means "matched this machine's os/arch
and has no recognised extension" — but this needs testing against real releases before it is a
rule, because it is the one part of this feature that fails quietly rather than loudly.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as the rule, and the testing the entry asked for is now
work rather than an assumption.** An extension decides the format; a name with no recognised
extension that matches this machine's os/arch is `binary`.

**The caveat is the reason the work is filed, not a reservation about the rule.** A wrong
*extension* guess produces an error. A wrong *`binary`* guess installs the wrong file and says
nothing — the one place in this feature that fails quietly rather than loudly. The entry said it
needed checking against real releases before becoming a rule; that never happened, and it is now
in the plan.

**CHECKED 2026-07-23, and the check found two live defects.** The asset lists of six real
releases (fd, jq, gh, neovim, rclone, helm) were fetched and every answer verified by hand, on
three platforms. The fixture is `src/backends/artifact/real_releases.txt` and the answers are
asserted, so this is a check that can fail rather than an inspection that happened once.

- **`accepts` is not "matched".** The code read the rule as *does not contradict this machine*,
  and the ruling says *matched*. Under the weak reading, `MD5SUMS` — a real asset of every
  rclone release, no extension, naming nothing — was an executable candidate on every platform,
  and so was anything else extension-less that a release happens to attach. **A `binary` now
  requires the filename to name this machine's os or arch**, which is what the ruling says.
  `@asset=` naming the file exactly overrides it, because naming it *is* the claim — otherwise
  a project shipping one bare `mytool` would become uninstallable.
- **`linux64` named no operating system.** The token matcher required a non-alphanumeric after
  an alias, so `linux` inside `jq-linux64` — a real asset of jq's release — did not match, and
  the file read as running anywhere. On Windows it was an executable candidate. A closing run of
  digits is part of the boundary now (`linux64`, `win64`, `mac64`), while the leading boundary
  is unchanged so `386` still does not match inside `i386`.

**The one thing left as a question was ruled 2026-07-24 and is now fixed.** On jq and rclone the
selector chose the project's **source tarball** over a binary naming the exact machine, because
the tie-break ranked format order above specificity even when that order was *detected* rather
than asked for. **Owner ruled: a detected order yields to the machine; a `@formats=` the user
wrote still wins outright.** The tie-break now leads with specificity when
`FormatOrder::is_user_specified()` is false and with format rank when it is true; jq resolves to
`jq-linux-amd64`, and a user who writes `@formats=tarball` still gets the tarball. The macOS
default order also gained `zip` in the same change — gh, rclone and starship ship their macOS
build as one and resolved to nothing without it. Both are covered by the real-release fixture,
whose expectations are now the file a human would pick on every row.

## K5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Built as recommended.

**K5 — May a level-3 reset (X.3) run while a config repo exists?** Forgetting the registry
while the declarations remain leaves Shall believing it manages nothing and the files saying
otherwise. *Recommendation:* refuse unless the repo is empty or `--force`, and say which.
**BUILT the recommendation, 2026-07-20:** `shall reset` refuses when `modules/`, `profiles/`
or `active` exists unless `--force`, and the refusal names the repo path and both ways forward.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** `shall reset` refuses while a config repo
exists unless `--force`, and the refusal names the repo and both ways forward. Forgetting the
registry while the declarations remain leaves Shall believing it manages nothing and the files
saying otherwise, and there is no reading of that state that is not a trap.

## K11

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `config/settings.rs:17` — `const ONLY_KEY: &str = "config_root"`, enforced by the parser.

**K11 — May Shall's settings file (X.6) hold anything besides the repo path?** *Recommendation:*
no, and the refusal should be enforced by the parser, not by discipline. **A file holding exactly
one key is the file that grows a second one** — and the moment it does, there are two preference
systems (it and `preferences.toml`) and a new question about which wins on every key either
could hold. The one key it holds is the one key `preferences.toml` structurally cannot.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** One key, enforced by the parser rather than
by discipline. A second key would make two preference systems, and every key either file could
hold would raise a new question about which one wins.

## K14

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `handle_rebuild` never reaches `git_autocommit`. **No test asserts it**, as the entry says.

**K14 — Does `rebuild` produce a git commit?** Nothing about the declared state changed, so
there is nothing to commit — but a history that does not record a rebuild means `git log` is no
longer a complete account of what happened to the machine (II.4's claim). *Recommendation:* no
commit; `rebuild` is recorded wherever snapshots are, not wherever intent is.

**The recommendation holds and is what the code does** — `handle_rebuild` never calls
`perform_maintenance`, which is the only path to `git_autocommit`. **It is still not asserted by
a test** (2026-07-21): the honest one needs a backend that can really remove and reinstall, and
a test that only greps the source would pass on a rebuild that committed through some other
route. Recorded rather than faked.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** `rebuild` writes no git commit. Nothing about
the declared state changed, so there is nothing to record as intent; a rebuild is recorded
wherever snapshots are.

**The test stays owed and is filed.** A test that greps the source would pass on a rebuild that
committed through some other route, so the honest one needs a backend that really removes and
reinstalls.

**Checked 2026-07-23: the test exists and has never been run.** `docker/integration/run-in-container.sh`
section 12 does exactly what this entry asks — a real package removed and reinstalled, and git
asked directly for its commit count rather than `shall git log`. It cannot run here: there is no
container runtime on the development machine, and the harness installs and removes real system
packages, so pointing it at the WSL install would not be a test, it would be an incident. **Filed
as Phase 6, not as owed work** — the code is written, the run is what is missing.

## K16

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Built as recommended.

**K16 — Does `clean-cache --all` need the guard?** It removes no packages, so today's answer is
no (R19 established exactly this reasoning for `clean-cache`). Level 3 of X.3 is a different
command and does need confirmation. *Recommendation:* keep the split — the guard protects
packages, not disk space, and widening it to cover caches dilutes what a guard refusal means.
**BUILT the split, 2026-07-20:** `clean-cache --all` takes no confirmation and no guard (it
touches caches and `tmp_dir`, no installed software); `shall reset` takes the typed-count
confirmation because it destroys the registry. The reason is written into `handle_clean_cache`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** `clean-cache --all` takes no guard and no
confirmation. **The guard protects packages, not disk space** — widening it to cover caches would
dilute what a guard refusal means, and the worst outcome of a wrong `clean-cache --all` is
re-downloading.

**`shall reset` is not part of this entry and was only ever the contrast** (owner asked,
2026-07-23). It is a different command answering a different question: it makes every managed
package unmanaged, which is why it takes the typed-count confirmation and `clean-cache` does not.
K5 is where that lives. Recorded because the contrast read as though the two were one decision.

## U5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**U5 — Does `setting:` get a Windows registry adapter and a macOS `defaults` adapter?** This is
P7's first real test. *Recommendation:* yes, registry first — it is the cleanest
read-before-write store on any platform, and it is the difference between Shall declaring a
Windows machine's software and declaring the machine.

**ANSWERED by K7's ruling (owner, 2026-07-23): yes.** `setting:` must work everywhere, so the
registry and `defaults` adapters are owed rather than optional. *(This once read "does not unblock the work — U19 is still open".)* **U19 is answered and
built** (2026-07-24): `@scope=user|system`, defaulting to whatever the store does anyway, and it
is the convention macOS `defaults` inherits. **Nothing blocks the adapters now**; they are simply
unwritten — `setting_stores.toml` still ships `gsettings` and nothing else.

---

## D1

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `github.rs:159` takes GitHub's own `releases/latest` (non-draft, non-prerelease) and `:241` strips a leading `v` from a `@version=` pin. The recommendation's "errors if both exist" half is not there.

**D1 — What is "the release"?** `github:sharkdp/fd` names a repo, not a version. GitHub has
draft releases, prereleases, and tags that never became releases at all. And `@version=10.2.0`
has to mean *something* here — a tag, presumably, but tags are `v10.2.0` about half the time.
*Recommendation:* latest non-draft, non-prerelease release; `@version=` matches the tag with and
without a leading `v` and errors if both exist; no "track prereleases" option until someone asks.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built, and the missing half is owed.** The release is
GitHub's newest non-draft, non-prerelease; `@version=` matches the tag with and without a leading
`v`. **Owed:** a repo carrying both `10.2.0` and `v10.2.0` as tags must be an error naming both.
Today one wins silently, which is the quiet failure this whole entry existed to prevent.

**ALREADY BUILT when the ruling was written — checked 2026-07-23, nothing to do.** `one_release`
(`github.rs`) returns `Error::Validation` naming both tags when both spellings resolve, and
`resolve_release` is its only caller, so there is no second path where one wins silently. Tests:
`a_pin_that_answers_to_both_spellings_is_an_error_naming_both` and
`either_spelling_alone_resolves_to_that_release`. It landed on **2026-07-20** in `8a63c80`, three
days before the entry said it was missing. **This is the tree being better than the sentence
again** — the same direction Part VII warns about, and the reason "In the tree today" lines are
worth re-running rather than reading.

## D10

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `backends/artifact/format.rs` — one `Format` enum, one `ALL` table, the error names the legal set.

**D10 — The closed vocabulary, and where it lives.** VIII.2 fixes ten names and makes an
eleventh an error. That list has to live somewhere both the parser and the error message read
from, or it drifts — and a typed list of names that drifts is precisely the failure this document
has recorded seven times. *Recommendation:* one table in the grammar crate, and the error message
prints it rather than restating it.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** One table, and the error prints the legal set
rather than restating it.

## W1

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `$` shipped throughout `model/vars.rs`; a bare name is not accepted.

**W1 — The sigil: `$role`, or bare `role`?** IX.4 argues for `$`. The counter-argument is real:
bare names read better, the reserved set is five words and could simply be reserved forever, and
`$` in a file that is not a shell invites people to expect shell semantics (`${}`, `$(…)`,
env fallthrough) that will not exist. *Recommendation:* keep the sigil — the future-fact
collision is the kind of quiet, delayed breakage this document has recorded seven times — but
this is the single most reversible-now, expensive-later choice in the part.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** The sigil stays. `$role`, never bare.

---

## W6

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `model/vars_provider.rs:43` ignores directories by name: *"a `vars.d/` …"*.

**W6 — Is `vars` one file or a directory?** One file matches `active`/`priority`. A repo with
forty machines may want `vars.d/`. *Recommendation:* one file; revisit only with a real fleet
complaining.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** One file. A `vars.d/` directory stays ignored
by name until a real fleet asks otherwise.

---

## K7

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `backends/setting.rs` — the `SettingStore` enum is `GSettings` and `None`; `None` makes every `setting:` line an error.

**K7 — Which desktops does `setting:` adapt to, and in what order?** In scope as of the owner's
ruling (X.4), so the question is no longer whether. GNOME via `gsettings` is the largest
population and the cleanest adapter (typed schemas, readable current values); KDE via
`kwriteconfig` is ini files with no schema, so *reading the current value* — which X.4 requires —
is harder there. *Recommendation:* GNOME first, KDE second, and **`setting:` refuses on a desktop
with no adapter rather than falling back to writing something.** A key silently unapplied is
worse than an error, because the whole point is that the file is the truth.

**BUILT the recommendation, 2026-07-20: GNOME via `gsettings`, KDE refused for now.** The
`SettingStore` enum has exactly `GSettings` and `None`; a desktop that resolves to `None` makes
every `setting:` line an error naming the missing adapter. KDE joins by adding a variant and its
three command mappings — the pure-function shape is set up so that is the whole change.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): `setting:` must work everywhere. GNOME-only is a stage, not the
answer.** The recommendation is confirmed as far as it goes and its scope is rejected: KDE, the
Windows registry and macOS `defaults` are all owed, not optional, because **P7 says a feature is
unfinished until Windows and macOS have an equivalent or a written reason there can be none** —
and there is no such reason here. Every one of these stores can be read before it is written,
which is the only property X.4 requires.

**The refusal survives the ruling, and is the reason the ruling is safe.** A store with no
adapter makes every `setting:` line an error naming it. That is what lets the adapters land one
at a time without any of them being able to silently not apply a key.

**Everywhere means everywhere, and the named stores below are a priority order, not the set
(owner, 2026-07-23).** A blessed list of five is a list that is always missing the sixth, and the
machine holding the sixth gets an error for a key Shall could perfectly well have written. The
rule is the general one: **`setting:` adapts to whatever settings store the machine is actually
running.** The table is where to start, not where to stop.

**This forces a mechanism question the old ruling did not have, recorded as [K17](#k17).** A
closed Rust `enum SettingStore` cannot mean *everywhere*: every new desktop would be a Shall
release, and the machine that needs it is the one that cannot wait for one.

**The stores, in the owner's own order of need (2026-07-23):**

| store | how a value is read and written | state |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows registry** | the registry itself, typed | **owed, and first** — the owner's daily machine |
| **KDE** | `kreadconfig5`/`kreadconfig6`, `kwriteconfig` | owed |
| **COSMIC** | the file tree under `~/.config/cosmic/`, one file per key | owed |
| **Hyprland** | a plain text config file, plus `hyprctl` at runtime | owed, **and it may not be a `setting:` at all** — see below |
| GNOME | `gsettings` | built, and **the one store the owner does not use** |

**Hyprland is a different shape and must not be forced into this one.** The other four are
key-value stores with a read API; Hyprland's truth is a text config file, with `hyprctl
getoption` reporting a runtime value that can disagree with it. A `setting:` line there means
Shall owning individual lines inside a file it did not write — which is not what any other
adapter does, and `link:` already places whole files. **Whether Hyprland is a `setting:` adapter,
a `link:` case, or a third thing is open and is not decided by this ruling.**

**This answers U5: yes.** It no longer waits on anything: the registry adapter's first line is
`HKCU` or `HKLM`, which is **U19 — answered and built** (`@scope=user|system`, 2026-07-24). The
adapter rows are unwritten work, not blocked work.

## K7b

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `backends/setting.rs` implements the statement form.

**K7b — What is the key syntax?** `setting:SCHEMA/KEY @value=…` is one spelling; a backend-shaped
`gsettings:org.gnome…` is another and would reuse the `backend:name` parser instead of adding a
statement. *Recommendation:* the statement form, because the desktop is not a backend (X.4) and
the adapter is chosen by what is running, not by what the user typed.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** The statement form. The desktop is not a
backend, and the adapter is chosen by what is running rather than by what the user typed.

---

## K8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** Built as recommended: the affected commands bail, `doctor` reports git as degraded.

**K8 — How does a git-less Shall announce what it cannot do?** Once at `init`, on every
affected command, or only in `doctor`. *Recommendation:* on the affected commands (they are
few, and that is where the user is when it matters) plus a `doctor` line. Never on `sync` —
warning on the command that runs unattended, every time, teaches people to ignore it.

**BUILT the recommendation, 2026-07-20.** The affected commands already said it — `rollback`,
`diff` and `history` each bail with "this needs git, run `shall git init`" rather than
crashing, and `git_autocommit` is a silent no-op without a repo. The one gap was the standing
`doctor` line, now added: `doctor` reports git as *degraded* (not a fault) when it is absent or
the config is not a repo, naming exactly what is unavailable. Nothing warns on `sync`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** The affected commands say it, `doctor` carries
the standing line, and `sync` never warns.

## K10

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `cli/args.rs:507` and `:520`; `main.rs:192-193`. Two commands, exactly the recommendation.

**K10 — `shall edit` and `shall path`, or flags on an existing command?** *Recommendation:* two
small commands, because both are things a shell wants to call directly.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** Two commands, because both are things a shell
calls directly.

---

## K11b

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `config/settings.rs` — the platform config dir, and a flat file rather than a nested one so it cannot land inside the repo it locates.

**K11b — What is that file called and where exactly does it live?** It is not in the repo, not in
git, and not scanned; beyond that the platform config dir and `$SHALL_DATA_DIR` are both
defensible. *Recommendation:* the platform config dir — it is configuration, not data, and
putting it next to the data dir invites the assumption that deleting the data dir is safe.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): confirmed as built.** The platform config directory, and a flat
file rather than a nested one so it cannot land inside the repo it exists to locate.

---

## K13

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-23.**

**In the tree today:** `schedule.rs` carries a `NEVER_UNATTENDED` list.

**K13 — Does `rebuild` appear in `schedules`?** *Recommendation:* no, and the parser should
refuse it by name, for the reason in X.1. A destructive repair operation that can be scheduled
is one that will run at 3am on a machine nobody is watching.

**BUILT (2026-07-20): the parser refuses it.** `schedule.rs` carries a `NEVER_UNATTENDED` list
(`rebuild`, `purge-unmanaged`) checked against the first word of `run`, so `run = sync --locked`
still parses. The refusal names the command and says why.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-23): REVERSED, and generalised. The forbidden set is a list in config,
defaulted, and each command in it is independently removable.**

The hardcoded `NEVER_UNATTENDED` constant goes. In its place, **one `[guard]` list naming the
commands this machine refuses to run unattended, shipped with `rebuild` and `purge-unmanaged` in
it.** Taking a name out is how you permit it; that is the "one key for each" the owner asked for,
without a key per command and without a new mechanism the next dangerous verb would need adding
to by hand.

- **The default preserves today's behaviour exactly.** A config that says nothing refuses both
  commands, as it does now, so no existing setup changes meaning.
- **It answers the sibling in the same change.** `purge-unmanaged` is not a separate ruling and
  does not need one — it is a row in the same list, removable on the same terms, which is what
  makes this a fix to the class rather than to `rebuild`.
- **It is a `[guard]` list, not a `[schedules]` one.** `[schedules]` in `preferences.toml` was
  deleted by the 2026-07-20 audit so the `schedules` file is the only schedule store;
  resurrecting it would be the zombie key that audit killed.
- **The refusal names the list.** A `schedules` entry naming a forbidden command is refused with
  the list's own name in the message, so the way out is in the error rather than in the docs.

**BUILT 2026-07-23, exactly as ruled.** `[guard] never_unattended`, defaulted to `["rebuild",
"purge-unmanaged"]`; the `NEVER_UNATTENDED` constant is deleted. The list reaches
`schedule_config` as an argument rather than being read inside the model, so the rule has one
home (`preferences.toml`) and the check is testable without a config on disk. The refusal quotes
the key **and its current contents**. Five tests, including the two the ruling's own wording
implies and nothing else would have covered: **taking a name out permits that command and leaves
the other refused**, and **an empty list refuses nothing** — the alternative, an empty list
silently restoring the built-in pair, is the shape that makes a guard setting unable to mean what
it says.

## D3

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**D3 — Two assets, same format, both legal for this machine.** `fd_10.2.0_amd64.deb` and
`fd-musl_10.2.0_amd64.deb`. `formats = deb` selects both and must pick one.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20): shortest filename wins, said out loud, plus `@asset=` taking a
pattern.** Four parts, and the fourth is a separate axis the question surfaced:

1. **Default: shortest matching filename**, and the selection is *reported* — the plan names the
   asset it chose and the ones it passed over, and the chosen name goes in `locks/github` so it
   cannot drift under a pinned line. A guess that is printed and locked is not the silent guess
   D3 was afraid of.
2. **`@asset=` takes a glob, not just an exact name.** `@asset=*musl*` survives a version bump;
   an exact name does not, and a pin that needs re-editing every release is a pin nobody keeps.
3. **`@asset=` narrows, it does not select.** When the pattern still matches several, rule 1
   applies among the matches. One tie-break in the system, not two.
4. **`@asset=all` installs every match** rather than picking. This is the one shape the original
   question did not contain: a release that ships several artifacts you genuinely want.

**This answers D16** (`gnu` vs `musl` is exactly rule 1 plus `@asset=*musl*`) and closes it.

---

## D4

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**D4 — What does installing a `tarball`/`zip`/`binary` actually do?** A `.deb` is
self-installing; an archive is not. Something has to decide where it extracts, which file inside
it is the executable, and what lands on `PATH`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20): extract, find the executable, shim it — with `@bin=` to name it
when the guess is wrong.**

- Shall extracts to its own artifact directory and **must not invent a second way onto `PATH`.**
  A second PATH mechanism is the two-of-everything failure with a new name.

  > **Corrected 2026-07-20: this said "reuses `shim:`", and `shim:` cannot do this job.** A
  > shim is the shall binary deployed under the target's name; on startup it reads its own
  > filename and re-dispatches, running the bare name through `PATH`. Pointed at an extracted
  > binary that is *not* on `PATH`, it would find itself. `shim:` is a re-dispatch mechanism,
  > not a deployment one, and the two are different features that happen to write to the same
  > directory. **The rule that survives is the one that mattered: one deployment mechanism, not
  > one per backend.** See the 2026-07-20 entry in Part VII.
- **The default guesses**, by looking for an executable whose name matches the package. The guess
  is *reported* in the plan, like D3's — the same discipline, for the same reason.
- **`@bin=PATH` names the executable inside the archive** (`github:foo/bar@bin=build/bar`) and
  turns the guess off. It is the escape hatch for odd layouts and for archives holding several
  executables.
- **An archive where the guess finds nothing, or finds several, is an error listing what it
  found** — never a silent pick. D3's tie-break is for *assets*, not for executables inside one:
  two binaries in a tarball are two different programs, and shortest-name is meaningless there.

## D6

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**D6 — `@sha256` cannot cover a per-machine asset.** A shared module says
`github:x/y@sha256=…`, but the Ubuntu box downloads the `.deb` and the Fedora box downloads the
`.rpm`. **One hash cannot verify two files.** So either the checksum option is per-asset (a list,
keyed by filename — verbose, and generated by hand), or it is only legal alongside a single
pinned format, or checksums move into `locks/github` as generated content and stop being a
hand-written option. This collides directly with the unimplemented SEC checksum work in Phase 5
and **must be settled with it, not separately.**

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20): checksums live in `locks/`, generated.** Shall records the hash of
the artifact it actually downloaded, per machine, beside the asset name and URL VIII.2 already
puts there. `@sha256=` remains legal **only on a line that pins exactly one format**, where one
hash can cover one file and the user is asserting something checkable; anywhere else it is an
error saying why. *(Options offered: the lock, a per-asset hand-written list keyed by filename,
or legal-only-alongside-a-pinned-format with no lock changes.)*

Two consequences that follow and are not separately decidable:

- **This is the same work as the Phase 5 SEC checksum items**, not an adjacent feature. The
  `web`/`appimage`/`github` verification path and this lock field are one implementation.
- **A hash in the lock is a record, not a policy.** It says what was downloaded, so a change is
  visible in `shall diff` and a re-download that differs is an error. It does not by itself
  demand that the user pre-declare anything, which is what makes it work on a fleet where the
  asset differs per machine.

## D7

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**D7 — Does a `github { formats = … }` block in `priority` mean the backend is enabled?**
V.15 says listed = available. A block with an options body is still a listing, so presumably yes
— but then a user who writes only a formats block has silently enabled a backend. *Recommendation:*
yes, it enables — one list, one question, exactly as V.15 argues. Say so explicitly.

**ADOPTED and BUILT (2026-07-20): yes, a body is a listing.** `Priority::parse` pushes the
backend onto the order and stores its body, so a lone `github { formats = deb }` both enables
`github` and sets its default. One list answering one question, as V.15 argues. The alternative
— a body that configures a backend without enabling it — would mean `priority` had two kinds of
mention with different force, which is the `backend_priority`/`enabled_backends` split V.15
already deleted once.

---

## D9

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**D9 — A line's `formats` replaces the backend's list. Confirm.** VIII.2 asserts replace-not-
extend. The alternative (prepend the line's entries, keep the backend's as fallback) is more
forgiving and produces an order nobody wrote. *Recommendation:* replace, as written — but it is
an assertion I made, not a ruling, so it is listed here.

**ADOPTED and BUILT (2026-07-20): replace, at both seams.** `to_spec` writes the backend's
`priority` body into the spec first and lets the line's own options overwrite the key whole, so
all three levels compose as *line beats `priority` beats built-in default* with no partial
merge at either step. The merge happens once, in the one function that turns a declaration into
a spec, rather than in each backend — a backend that resolved its own precedence would be the
second implementation of it.

## W2

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W2 — Are values typed?** IX.2 shows strings only. But `when $role in [travel, work]` already
exists in the grammar, so a list value is a natural request, and `when $gpu == true` reads worse
than a flag. Options: strings only and every comparison is a string compare (simplest, one type,
no coercion surprises); or add lists; or add booleans. ~~*Recommendation:* strings only for v1.~~

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20): full JSON types — strings, numbers, booleans, lists.** The
position-1 recommendation above is void, as IX.6 said every W recommendation is. A provider that
returns JSON has these types already, and flattening them to strings at the boundary throws away
information the user deliberately produced. *(Options offered: strings only, strings plus lists,
or full JSON types.)*

**This buys a coercion problem, and the coercion rules are the work.** They are not a detail
that falls out of the implementation — each one is a place a comparison can quietly answer the
wrong question, so each is decided here or it is decided by accident:

- **No cross-type coercion in comparisons.** `"1" == 1` is **false**, not true, and not an
  error. A provider that returns a JSON string is making a claim about the type, and silently
  equating it to a number would make the type annotation meaningless.
- **`==` and `!=` are legal between any two values; ordering (`<`, `>`) is legal only between
  numbers.** Ordering strings invites version-compare expectations Shall cannot honour —
  `"10" > "9"` is false under every string ordering and true under every intuition.
- **`in` tests list membership** with the same no-coercion equality.
- **There is no truthiness.** W3's "no bare `$flag`" holds and gets stronger: `when $gpu` stays a
  parse error suggesting `$gpu == true`, so an empty string, `0`, `false` and `[]` never quietly
  differ from each other.
- **A detected fact is still a string**, and comparing `$var` to one follows the rule above.

**BUILT (2026-07-20, fourth session).** `model/vars::Value` is the four types; one `parse_literal`
reads a `vars` line and a `when` right-hand side alike; `Value::equals`/`Value::order` and
`config/parser::eval_when` enforce every rule above. `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` are new to `when` and
refuse a non-number pair by name. One deviation, recorded: **string equality is
case-insensitive**, preserving the detected-fact behaviour `os == LINUX` has always had.

**Owed:** the value type lands in Part II with a Part V entry naming the bug (a comparison that
answers a question the reader did not ask), and `shall vars` (W12) prints the type alongside the
value or the whole feature is undebuggable. **Deferred until stages 2–6 land**, so Part II does not
describe a half-built feature.

---

## W3

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W3 — Is a bare `$flag` a condition?** `when $gpu { … }` meaning "non-empty" is the obvious
shorthand and it needs deciding before people write `gpu = false` and find that it fires.
*Recommendation:* no bare form — require an explicit comparison, and make `when $gpu` a parse
error suggesting `$gpu == …`. **`false` as a truthy string is a footgun with no upside.**
**ADOPTED and BUILT (2026-07-20, fourth session):** a bare `$flag` in `when` is a parse error
naming the fix.

---

## W4

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W4 — Where in resolution does `vars` load?** It has to be parsed and resolved before any file
containing `when` is evaluated, including `active` — which means before profiles are known. And
`vars` itself contains `when` over detected facts. So: detect facts â†’ resolve `vars` â†’ everything
else. *Recommendation:* state this as a fixed phase in II.7, because getting it wrong produces an
ordering bug that will look like an intermittent one. **BUILT (2026-07-20):** vars resolve once
per invocation, before any `when` is evaluated (`resolve_model`), and the resolved set is carried
on the facts and frozen into a saved plan so `apply` reuses it rather than re-running a provider
that could disagree (Stage 5). Owed: writing the phase into II.7 as text.

---

## W5

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W5 — What does `shall check` do with `vars`?** `check` parses everything on demand (II.3). A
variable defined but never used is harmless; a variable *used* but not defined is an error W3/IX.3
catches at parse time. But an unused variable on a fleet may mean "the block that used it was
deleted on this branch". *Recommendation:* `check` reports unused variables as a note, not an
error. **BUILT (2026-07-20, fifth session).** It is not done through resolution but by a static
scan, which is the *more* correct reading of the intent: `model/vars::referenced_names` reads
every `$name` out of the model files (`modules/`, `profiles/`, `active`, `priority`, `schedules`,
and a line-file `vars`), and `check` lists any resolved variable absent from that set as a note,
never an error. Static because the motivating case is a fleet — a variable used only in another
host's `when host == …` arm must count as used, and this host's resolution never reaches that
arm. So the answer is the whole repo's references, not just the ones this box hit.

---

## W7

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W7 — The undetectable variable — is there an escape hatch?** "Is this a work machine" is not
derivable from hostname, os, or arch on every fleet, and **IX.1's central claim quietly depends
on it usually being derivable.** When it is not, the options are: an env var
(`SHALL_VAR_ROLE=work`) — which makes the resolved state depend on how the command was invoked,
and II.6 already establishes wariness there (*"an unset `$PROFILE` must not empty the machine"*);
a gitignored local file — which is per-machine hand-maintained state, the exact thing II.1
forbids; or a refusal, forcing the user to add a `when hostname ==` arm. *No recommendation.*
**This is the decision that determines whether IX.1's argument is honest or a technicality,
and it should be ruled on before anything else in this part.**
**ANSWERED by the provider model (2026-07-20):** an external `vars.py` or the embedded `env(name)`
reads `SHALL_VAR_ROLE` (or any variable) itself, so the escape hatch is the environment via a
provider — no per-machine committed state, no Shall-level env-var mechanism. The `env()` host
function is built (Stage 4).

---

## W8

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W8 — Do variables work in `active`?** `when $role == travel { Travel }` is the single most
useful place for this feature and also the place with the sharpest edge: `activate` and
`deactivate` edit `active` as a file (II.6), including its `when` blocks, and they currently
reason about host blocks specifically — *"Travel is not active on this host, `active` line 4
activates it when host == laptop"*. That message and that logic have to learn variables.
*Recommendation:* yes, allow it, and treat the `activate`/`deactivate` message work as part of
the feature rather than a follow-up — a half-taught `deactivate` would report a state it did not
reach, which II.6 already calls out as the defect to avoid.
**CORE BUILT (2026-07-20):** `when $role == travel { Travel }` in `active` resolves — it read its
own varless facts before and failed with "unknown when key `$role`"; `parse_active` now threads the
run's facts (which carry the variables).

**COMPLETE (2026-07-20, sixth session), and it was a bug, not only a message.** The resolution path
had been taught variables; **every path that EDITS your files had not.** `activate -a`,
`deactivate`, `uninstall` and `declares` all read `active` through `HostFacts::current()`, whose
variable set is empty — and an empty set does not make `when $role == travel` a block that fails to
match, it makes `$role` an unknown key. Each of those verbs refused a correct file outright. Fixed
by deleting the varless readers rather than defaulting them: `parse_active`/`read_active` take
facts, `Editor::new` takes facts, and **`StateResolver::facts_for_host` is the one place that
produces them** (`resolve_model` now calls it instead of resolving variables inline). The messaging
half is `model::profiles::describe_gate`: a block is named with its variables' current values —
*"`when $role == travel` ($role is desktop)"* — because `active` holds the condition and `vars`
holds the value, and pointing a reader at the first without the second explains nothing. Verified
against the binary: `deactivate Trip` on a `when $role == travel` block reports the removal, the
emptied block, and the value, where it used to fail to parse the file.

---

## W11

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W11 — Does `why` explain a variable?** When a package is present because
`when $role == travel` matched, `shall why` should say *"`$role` is `travel`, set at `vars`
line 6 by `when host in [thinkpad, x220]`"* — one hop further than it explains today.
*Recommendation:* yes, and W4's fixed resolution phase is what makes it cheap. Decide before
the resolver is written. **BUILT (2026-07-20, sixth session).** The definition half was W12's
`VarOrigins`. The gating half is now built: the resolver's per-statement `conditional` flag became
a **chain** of `Gate`s (a predicate and the line it is written on, `Gates` beside `Origin` in the
grammar — two questions, two answers). The chain composes across all three levels that can gate a
package — the `active` block that turned the profile on, the profile's block around its `use`, the
module's own block — and lands on the spec as `__gated_by`, filtered to the conditions that test a
variable, which is the hop `why` cannot make from the file alone. `why` prints it under
`because:`.

**A package or module reached twice keeps the shortest chain.** Reached once inside a condition and
once outside it, it is here unconditionally, and an explanation that names the condition anyway is
a wrong answer, not a partial one.

`to_spec`'s three provenance arguments became one `Provenance` in the same pass: origin, scopes and
gates answer three different questions and had begun to read as interchangeable, which is the
mistake that made `upgrade --module dev` match a filename.

---

## W12

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W12 — Is there a command to print resolved variables?** `shall vars`, showing each name, its
value on this machine, and which line set it. Debugging a fleet without it means reading the
file and simulating the `when` blocks by hand. *Recommendation:* yes — small, and it is the
first thing anyone will want when a block does not fire. **BUILT (2026-07-20), completed fifth
session:** `shall vars` prints each name, its typed value, its type, the active provider (line
file / external / embedded), and now *"set at vars:6"* — the winning definition's line, or the
provider file for a script. Resolution carries a `VarOrigins` map beside the value set
(`resolve_with_origins`/`load_vars_with_origins`), computed by the one resolution core so the
value path never pays for it. This is the origin foundation W11 needs.

---

## W13

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W13 — Does changing a variable go through the guard?** It must: editing one line in `vars`
can deactivate a profile and remove a hundred packages. That is the ordinary plan-and-guard path
(II.8) and needs no new mechanism — but it does mean **a one-line edit to `vars` is potentially
the most destructive edit in the repo**, and the plan output should make the cause visible
rather than presenting a hundred unexplained removals. **CORE SATISFIED by construction
(2026-07-20):** variables feed the desired state, which feeds the plan, which feeds the guard — a
`vars` edit that removes a hundred packages hits `max_removals`/`protected` like any other change.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20, fifth session): the plan shows a run-level note, not per-package
attribution.** The three options were a run-level note (compare the plan's frozen vars to this
run's and print *"Variables changed: role (travel â†’ desktop)"* above the removals), per-package
attribution (resolve twice and diff the gating, so each removed package names the variable that
dropped it), or nothing. The owner chose the note. It is decoupled from the W11/W8 gating-side
tracking entirely — the plan already freezes its resolved vars (Stage 5), so the note is a diff
of two `Vars` maps with no second resolution and no per-package guesswork. It gives the cause
next to the count, which is the property W13 asks for. **BUILT (fifth session):** the plan/sync
preview prints changed variables above the removals when the run's vars differ from the frozen
plan's.

---

## W14

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**W14 — Does `vars` belong in `shall diff`?** Phase 4 limits `diff` to
`modules/profiles/active/priority/schedules`. **`vars` has to join that list or the file that
explains a change is the one file the change view cannot show.** *Recommendation:* yes; this is
a one-line fix that will be forgotten if it is not written down here. **BUILT (2026-07-20):**
`diff` and the git manifest views match `vars*` (the line file and every provider file).

---

## K1

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**K1 — Does `rebuild` remove everything before installing anything, or one package at a time?**
*This is the whole feature.* All-at-once genuinely forces orphan collection and can leave the
machine unusable partway through; one-at-a-time is safe and collects nearly nothing, because a
shared dependency is never orphaned at any instant. Batch-per-backend is a third answer.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-20): batch per backend.** All of one backend's declared packages come
down, then all of them go back up, then the next backend. The reasoning the ruling settles on:

- **It collects.** Within a backend, a dependency shared only by packages that are all removed
  in the same batch really does become an orphan, so the repair actually repairs — which
  one-at-a-time does not.
- **It bounds the blast radius.** A failure strands one backend's software, not the machine.
  A box mid-`rebuild` of `cargo` still has a shell, a package manager and a network stack,
  because those are `apt`'s batch and `apt`'s batch already finished or has not started.
- **The backend is the unit the orphan question is asked in anyway.** `apt` cannot orphan a
  `cargo` crate. Batching by backend is not a compromise between the two extremes; it is the
  granularity at which the underlying operation is defined.

**Backend order is therefore load-bearing and is not the registry's iteration order.** The
backend that owns the shell and the system libraries goes first.

**RULED and built (2026-07-20): foundation first, where foundation is `needs_root()`, then the
rest, each tier in `priority` order.** The blast-radius reasoning first offered for this — put
the risky batch first so a strand lands furthest from boot — **is wrong and is not the reason**;
`apt` stranding first is the worst outcome available, not the best. The reason is dependency
direction: a crate can need a system compiler, and no system package has ever needed a crate.
See V.49.

---

## K3

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**K3 — What does `rebuild` do when the reinstall fails after the removal succeeded?** The
machine is now missing declared software and the command is halfway. Snapshot-and-revert
(II.10's pre-sync snapshot path) is the existing mechanism and probably the answer, but it has
to be decided, because "rebuild left me with nothing" is the review this feature gets if it is
not.

**RULED and BUILT (owner, 2026-07-20): snapshot, and revert on a failed reinstall.**
*(Options offered: snapshot-and-revert, stop-and-report, or refuse to start without a snapshot
provider.)* Three things the ruling settles that the question did not contain:

1. **One snapshot, taken before the first removal — not one per batch.** A per-batch snapshot
   could only restore the batch that failed, and by then an earlier backend has already been
   rebuilt on top of it. The unit of the rollback is the rebuild, not the batch.
2. **No snapshot provider is not a refusal.** `rebuild` still runs and says up front that a
   failure cannot be rolled back automatically, falling back to stop-and-name-what-is-missing.
   Refusing outright would make the command unavailable on every plain ext4 box, which is most
   of them.
3. **A failed *restore* is reported as its own outcome.** The machine is then both half-rebuilt
   and un-restored, and saying "rolled back" would be a lie about the state the user is in.
   That error names the snapshot and says to restore it by hand before anything else.

---

## K9

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**K9 — Is the backup command `bundle`, an alias, or nothing?** **RULED 2026-07-22 (owner): it is
`bundle`, finished.** Open since 2026-07-19 with the implementation deliberately unproposed; the
constraint that was recorded then — **not a second archive writer** — is what decided it. `bundle`
already writes everything a backup needs and stops at a `RESTORE.md`, so the answer is the
missing half: **`restore DIR`**, a command rather than an instruction file, refusing a non-empty
config directory unless told otherwise, with an end-to-end test that runs **without git** because
that is the case X.5 leaves it carrying alone. Reasoned in **V.59**; the rule is in **II.8**.

---

## K15

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**K15 — Does `plan` distinguish a rebuild's removals from real ones?** A plan showing "remove
214 packages" when all 214 come straight back is technically true and will terrify the reader.
*Recommendation:* yes — the plan says *reinstall* where remove-then-install is the same package,
and reserves *remove* for removals that stay removed.

**BUILT (2026-07-21).** `rebuild` prints its own plan, which never says "remove". The gap was
that the two transactions it runs go through the ordinary `sync` path, whose summary narrated
214 removals — the sentence K15 exists to prevent. The engine is now told which run it is
narrating (`metrics::Narration`, from the guard scope): under a rebuild the counters read
`Reinstalled` and `Removed to reinstall`, and plain `Removals` is reserved for removals that
stay removed. The backends' own progress logs are unchanged, deliberately: `apt` really is
removing those packages at that moment.

# Parked — each on a condition, and the conditions are checked now

**A parking condition is a claim that has to be re-checked, and D15's was not.** It said "parked
until D5 is answered", D5 was ruled and built five days later, and the entry went on saying
PARKED — filed among the questions that need nothing, which is where a question that needs a
ruling goes to be missed. **Every `PARKED` entry names what it waits on; nothing re-read those
names when the thing arrived.** `scripts/decision-count.sh --check` now does: a parked `Status:`
line must carry `waits on <what>`, and the run fails if the clause is missing or names a decision
that has since been ANSWERED (V.109).

**D15 is parked twice over, and the second parking is the interesting one.** Freed by D5, it was
re-parked the same day on a *measurement* rather than ruled on an argument — because what it
turns on is a fact about snapd that nobody here has observed. A condition a script cannot check
(D16 waits on someone hitting the case; D15 waits on an experiment) is allowed and says so, since
a clause that reads as checkable and quietly is not would be worse than none.

## D15

**Status: PARKED — waits on a measurement of what snapd does to a sideloaded snap.** Parked once
before on D5; **D5 was ruled 2026-07-24 and built 2026-07-26**, so that brake came off and nobody
noticed, and the entry sat under a met condition for a week (V.109). Reopened 2026-07-31 and
**re-parked the same day, deliberately and on a different condition** — the owner declined to
rule it on an argument when twenty minutes of experiment settles it.

**The condition is an experiment, and it is small.** On a machine with snapd: install a snap from
a local file, then make it refresh, and record what snapd does to it. The answer decides this
entry outright and nothing else needs deciding first. **Re-parking on a measurement rather than
ruling on a guess is the point** — the alternative was a ruling whose reasoning was "probably".

**D15 — `.flatpak`/`.snap` assets in a GitHub release.** They exist. Adding them to the
vocabulary means `github` installing something `flatpak` then does not own — **D5's ownership
question, one layer worse.**

**What D5 settled, and what it does not.** The installing backend owns the artifact: the lock
records it, removal routes back through it, and `check`'s dedup and `purge-unmanaged` defer to
it. That machinery is generic — `backends/artifact/system_pkg.rs` and
`Queryable::owned_system_packages` — so a `.flatpak` handed to `flatpak install` would inherit
the same ownership rule a `.deb` handed to `dpkg` already has, and the question D15 was parked on
has an answer.

**What is still a question is whether the rule holds where the manager is a running service.**
`dpkg` writes a database and then stops; `snapd` and `flatpak` keep running, hold remotes, and
refresh on a schedule of their own. So the sharp form of D15 is no longer "who owns it" — it is
**what a sideloaded snap does over time**, and that has two possible answers and they fail in
opposite directions: if snapd refreshes it from the store, Shall's lock describes a file that has
been replaced; if it never refreshes it (a sideloaded snap has no store association to refresh
*from*), the declaration silently pins a build that ages forever while `check` reports it
healthy. **Which of those actually happens has not been measured** — it needs a machine with
snapd and a release asset, not an argument. A `.flatpak` from a release has the same shape one
step down.

**Two answers, failing in opposite directions, and nobody knows which one is real.** If snapd
refreshes a sideloaded snap from the store, the lock describes a build that has been replaced and
Shall believes the machine matches a config it no longer matches. If snapd *never* refreshes it —
plausible, because a sideloaded snap has no store association to refresh from — the declaration
pins a build that ages for ever, takes no security updates, and `check` calls it healthy.
Neither is acceptable and they need opposite fixes, which is exactly why guessing is worse than
waiting.

**A cheaper question may kill it first: does anyone actually ship these as release assets?**
Flatpak's distribution model is Flathub and snap's is the Snap Store; publishing the raw file to
a GitHub release is unusual. If it is rare, "no, and here is why" is a complete answer that costs
nothing to write.

*No recommendation, and deliberately not one.* The ownership half is answered; the half about a
manager that acts on its own schedule is a fact about snapd, and facts are measured.

---

## D16

**Status: PARKED — waits on someone actually hitting it.** Not on another decision: `D3`'s
ruling already covers the case in principle, and what is missing is a real machine where the
ambiguity bites. An event, not a question, so no check can tell when it arrives — which is
itself worth writing down, because the alternative is a condition that reads as checkable and is
not.

**D16 — libc variants** (`gnu` vs `musl`, both valid for this machine). A real ambiguity
`formats` cannot express, and a fourth axis is not worth opening until someone hits it. **D3's
answer probably resolves this one for free**, which is the argument for answering D3 properly
rather than expediently.

# The Q-series — what building it kept asking

Nineteen questions the code raised after the six proposal rounds closed, each one found by a
thing that did not work. They were filed under *Parked or closed* because they were appended to
the end of the file and that was the last heading in it — nineteen entries, none of them parked,
under a heading that said they were. **A section heading is a claim about what is under it**,
and this file's whole argument is that an unchecked claim rots.

## Q1

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q1 — Does a failed install leave its line in the file?** **RULED 2026-07-27 (owner): withdraw
it when it can never succeed.**

The two integration harnesses had contradicted each other *in writing* about this for months —
`run-in-container.sh:252` said "The failure must not be left in the manifest",
`integration-windows.sh:259` said "a pinned name that a manager could not install is a failed
sync, not a wrong name, and only a name nothing can resolve is withdrawn" — and neither claim
was in any spec file. Both harnesses then deleted the line themselves and asserted it was gone,
so neither reading was ever tested.

The rule: **a line is withdrawn when the sync failed in a way that cannot succeed on a second
attempt** — `Unresolvable` (no backend claims the name) *or* a `CommandFailed` the backend's own
`ExitPolicy` classified `Permanent`. Everything else keeps the line, because a dropped network,
a held lock or a failed hook all mean you did mean it and retrying is right.

Three constraints came with the ruling and are part of it:

1. **Permanence is read off `CommandFailed`, never off `Error::retryability()`.** That method
   also calls a refusal, a cancelled prompt, a bad config file and an unsupported platform
   `Permanent` — true about retrying, and none of them says the name was wrong. Deleting a
   declaration because someone answered "no" to a prompt would be worse than the wedge.
2. **Only lines the manager actually named are withdrawn.** A batch install whose manager
   stopped at the first bad name leaves the rest alone; withdrawing on a guess is the one
   outcome worse than keeping.
3. **A line kept on purpose says so, names its file, and says how to remove it** —
   `shall unmanage <line>`. The wedge was never only that the line stayed; it was that nothing
   told the user which file to open. A wedge with an exit is not a wedge.

The rule is in **II.8**; the reason is in **V.90**.

## Q2

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q2 — Is a package manager you never installed "critical"?** **RULED 2026-07-27 (owner): no —
absent is its own state.**

`shall check health` opened with `Backends: 25 OK, 0 degraded, 23 critical (of 48 total)` on an
ordinary Windows box where nothing was wrong: the 23 were managers the user does not have, like
apt and brew. Meanwhile the `shall check` rollup said `ok health 25 backend(s) ready`, so the
summary and the detail view disagreed about the same machine.

The rule: **`HealthStatus::Absent` means the manager is not installed here and nothing asked for
it. `Critical` means it is installed, or `priority` lists it, and it cannot work.** Absent is
never counted as a failure and never colours the verdict. Fail-loud is about failures; a
manager you never asked for is not one.

The rule is in **II.10**; the reason is in **V.91**.

## Q3

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q3 — What does a mistyped command exit with?** **RULED 2026-07-27 (owner): 1, and the
published table stays at four codes.**

`readme.md:708` publishes four exit codes and says "a script can branch on them". Measured,
`shall nosuchcommand`, `shall --nosuchflag` and `shall sync --badflag` all exited **2**, which
that table defines as "a read-only command looked and found work to do" — so a CI job following
the documentation read a typo as a drifted machine, defeating the entire purpose of code 2. The
cause is that clap uses 2 for usage errors and exits before Shall's own mapping runs.

The rule: **a usage error exits 1.** "Failed — something went wrong" is already in the table and
is exactly true; Shall did not do what was asked. No fifth code, because "the same four
everywhere" is the property the table is for.

Ruled with it, as a straight violation of the same published contract rather than a new
question: **every refusal exits 3.** `purge-unmanaged`'s ratio refusal exited 1 because it was
raised with `anyhow::bail!` instead of `Error::Refused`, so it never reached the mapping. The
harnesses could not see it: they assert refusals with `nok`, which accepts any non-zero code.

The rule is in **II.8**; the reason is in **V.92**.

## Q4

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q4 — Are unverified backends labelled "experimental"?** **RULED 2026-07-27 (owner): NO. They
are tested instead, and nothing ships until they are.**

The proposal — from the readiness review, and recommended by its author — was to split the
backend list into *supported* (has passed a real install â†’ list â†’ binary â†’ remove round-trip in
an automated gate) and *experimental* (everything else), and to say so in `check health`, in the
`priority` file `init` writes, and in the readme. 52 backends are registered and 22 have ever
been run against the real tool; every defect the review found lives in that remainder.

**The owner rejected it, and the reason is the rule:** *this codebase does things; it does not
cover for not doing them.* A label converts an unfinished job into a permanent disclaimer, and a
disclaimer nobody has to retire is one nobody does. Shall does not go to production until every
registered backend has been thoroughly tested and reviewed — so the work is the coverage, and
the missing coverage is a **release blocker**, not a caption.

What follows from it, and all of it is binding:

1. **No `experimental` or `supported` label exists** — not in `check health`, not in `priority`,
   not in the readme. There is nothing to add and nothing to grep for.
2. **`shall init` keeps scaffolding every manager it finds.** Scaffolding fewer would have been
   the same disclaimer written as a default.
3. **A backend with no real lifecycle in an automated gate blocks the release.** That is the
   thing to fix, and the only thing.
4. **No new backend is added until the current set passes.** Unchanged by this ruling and
   reinforced by it.

This one is a rule about the project, not about the program, so it has no Part II entry. Its
reason is in **V.93**, and the coverage it demands is tracked in `plan.md`.

## Q5

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q5 — Does `@unverified` reach past the backends that download?** **RULED 2026-07-28 (owner):
YES — add it.**

The flag was scoped to `web:`, `appimage:` and `github:`, the three places Shall itself fetches a
URL and runs the result, and II.2 said so: *"Downloading backends only."* helm broke the framing.
helm v4 verifies a plugin's signature before installing it, and a source that cannot carry one —
a git URL, which has no `.prov` beside it — is **refused outright**, not warned about:

```
Error: plugin source does not support verification. Use --verify=false to skip verification
```

So `helm:diff@url=https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff` could not be installed by any
declaration, and the readiness review's reading of this as an argv defect (E11) was wrong: helm
was correct and Shall had no way to say the one thing that would let it through.

The rejected repair was to put `--verify=false` in helm's install command. That is a global
switch — verification off for every helm plugin, every user, invisibly — which is the failure
`@unverified` is a per-line flag to prevent. A helm-specific flag (`@no_signature`) was also
rejected: two spellings of one decision.

What is binding:

1. **`@unverified` is legal on `helm:`**, where it becomes `--verify=false`. Without it, helm's
   verification stands and Shall passes no flag.
2. **The rule is "something would otherwise have checked"**, not "Shall downloads". II.2's option
   table says that now, and `backends/artifact/capability.rs` holds the one table both the
   grammar and the install path read.
3. **`@allow_http` did not follow.** The two never imply each other (SEC2); helm's plain-HTTP
   switch is for OCI registries Shall does not reach, so `@allow_http` on `helm:` stays refused.
4. **Per line, still.** An install batch whose specs disagree about the flag becomes two
   commands — a shared command would hand one line's opt-out to a line that never asked.
5. **Visible after the fact.** `status` lists it for as long as the package is installed, and the
   heading says *installed with* rather than *downloaded with*, since for helm Shall downloads
   nothing.

The rule is in **II.2**; the reason is in **V.94**.

## Q6

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q6 — May a definition in `adapters/backends.toml` take a built-in's name?** **RULED
2026-07-28 (owner): YES, and only by saying so — it is a key.**

The onboarder registered custom backends last and skipped any name already in use, so a
definition named `apt` was silently ignored. That kept a pulled config from hijacking `apt` by
guessing a popular name, and that half stays. But it also meant that when a manager changes its
CLI under Shall — helm v4's plugin signatures, pixi's renamed `global upgrade-all`, nimble's
`--` — the person watching it fail could see the fix and had no way to apply it before a
release.

What is binding:

1. **`overrides = true` on a definition replaces whatever holds that name**, built-in included.
   Absent, the collision is skipped with a warning that names the key.
2. **Two deliberate acts, never one.** The sentence in the definition, and II.12's approval of
   the file. A name alone changes nothing, which is the security property.
3. **Announced on every run that loads it**, naming the backend and the program it now runs —
   not once at approval time.
4. **`check health` answers for the replacement**, so an override whose binary is absent reports
   that backend critical. That needed no special case: health probes the definition that won.
5. **Backends only.** Snapshot providers, init systems and secret stores still never shadow a
   built-in. Same argument, different blast radius — a wrong `apt` installs the wrong thing, a
   wrong snapshot provider removes the rollback that was meant to save you. Widening is a
   separate ruling and has not been made.

The rule is in **II.1** (`adapters/`); the reason is in **V.95**.

## Q7

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q7 — Does the removal guard cover the resources a declaration puts in place, or only
packages?** **RULED 2026-07-28 (owner): the resources are guarded the same way.**

Deleting a `link:`, `service:`, `setting:`, `shim:`, `schedule:` or `repo:` line made the next
`sync` tear that resource down without counting it, without naming it in the plan or the
`--dry-run` preview, and without consulting `protected_packages`. Measured: five link targets
deleted — including one the user had protected — with `max_removals = 1` set, reported as
`already up to date`. `readme.md` had said for months that every path removing anything went
through one guard. There were eleven such paths and nine guards.

The alternative on the table was to leave the guard packages-only and merely *report* the
teardown before it happened. It was rejected on blast radius: a `link:` target can be a
decrypted secret, a `service:` is something running now, a `setting:` is system-wide.

What is binding:

1. **`protected_packages` applies to resources**, matched on the key and also on the final
   component of a path key — `protected_packages = ["vimrc"]` protects `link:/home/u/.vimrc`.
2. **The ceiling counts the whole command**, not each phase separately. *(Amended 2026-08-09
   by `Y20`: packages and resources are counted separately, against `max_removals` and
   `max_extra_removals`. The "whole command, not each phase" half stands unchanged; the
   "together" half does not.)*
3. **OS-essential and undeclarable do not apply.** No resource manager publishes an essential
   list, and no resource key parses as a package line — applying that second test would refuse
   every teardown on every machine forever.
4. **`--allow-mass-removal` answers the count and nothing else**, exactly as it does for
   packages. Protection stays a refusal (V.26).
5. **The teardown is announced before it happens**, at a level the default filter shows, and
   `sync` no longer reports `already up to date` over work it did.
6. **`shall repo remove` is guarded too** — the imperative twin of the `repo:` teardown. Guarding
   one and not the other is the twin-branch shape `history.md` records as S6.
7. **The claim is re-counted, not re-asserted.** `tests/removal_guard_enumeration_tests.rs`
   enumerates every removal call in `src/` and fails on one no ledger entry accounts for.

The rule is in **II.10**; the reason is in **V.96**.

## Q8

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q8 — Should the security refusals return the documented refusal code, or the failure code
they return today?** **RULED 2026-07-28 (owner): all of them return 3.**

`readme.md` publishes four exit codes "so a script can branch on them", and `3` means Shall
refused on purpose. That was true when it refused to remove too many packages and false for
every refusal about security. Nine sites, enumerated from the code rather than from the two
that were reported:

| site | refuses | rule | was |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/download.rs` | plain HTTP | SEC2 | `Validation` |
| `core/download.rs` | unverified, no `@sha256` | SEC2 | `Validation` |
| `core/executor.rs` | a secret nothing protects | T5 | `Other` |
| `backends/link.rs` | decrypt into the git repo | T2 | `Validation` |
| `app/hooks.rs` | unapproved hooks | II.12 | `Validation` |
| `app/shim_manager.rs` | deploy over a foreign file | SEC1 | `Validation` |
| `utils/file.rs` | deploy over a foreign file | SEC1 | `Validation` |
| `app/apply/dotfiles.rs` | files outside `$HOME` | SEC3 | `Other` |
| `app/snapshot_restore.rs` | a registry path that is a file-read primitive | — | `Snapshot` |

The last was one of five the grader could not classify. The other four —
`model/firewall.rs`, `model/health.rs` and `model/rehearsal.rs` twice — were **already
correct**: the message is built in one file and wrapped in `Error::Refused` in another, and a
scan whose window stopped at the file boundary read the split as an offence.

**The exit code is the lesser half.** `main.rs` stated that the `Error::Refused` arm was "the
one point every refusal in the program passes through, so no command can be added that refuses
without the hook hearing about it". Someone who wires `on_guard_refusal` to be told when Shall
refuses was told about a mass removal and **not** about a refused unverified download, an
unprotected secret or an unapproved hook — silent exactly where it matters most.

What is binding:

1. **Every refusal is `Error::Refused`**, whatever it refused, so exit 3 and the hook are
   properties of the variant rather than of each site remembering.
2. **The claim is tested, not commented.** `tests/grader_refusal_exit_code_tests.rs` enumerates
   every "refusing to" site, follows a message builder through as many hops as the code has,
   and separately fires a real approved hook through a real refusal.
3. **A refused declaration is kept, and said to be kept.** Shall refused the line *as written*
   and the refusal names what to change, so the line is what the user edits. It is no longer
   described as something `sync` "will try again", which promised a retry that fails
   identically forever.
4. **Retryability follows.** Moving off `Validation`/`Snapshot`/`Other` makes these `Permanent`
   rather than `Unknown`, which is the true answer: nothing about a second attempt differs.

The rule is in **II.10** and the exit-code table in `readme.md`; the reason is in **V.97**.

## Q9

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q9 — Should a verb that takes a backend name refuse one that does not exist, the way
`install` does?** **RULED 2026-07-28 (owner): yes, with `install`'s message.**

`install nosuchbackend:foo` refused loudly and named both the file to edit and the spelling to
check. `list -b nosuchbackend` printed nothing and exited 0 — and so did `aptt`, `APT`, and the
empty string. Zero rows and exit 0 is exactly what a real backend with nothing installed
prints, so a user who mistyped `--backend` was told, in the program's own voice, that the
manager was empty. Principle I is "fail loud, never silent", and one verb obeyed it while its
siblings did not.

**It also disarmed a check.** §8.1's A bar is "every `[READY]` backend can answer `list`". Run
over all 24 ready backends on a Windows host, all 24 exited 0 — and only 11 returned any rows.
The other 13 were indistinguishable from a name that does not exist, so the measurement could
not fail for half its subjects.

What is binding:

1. **Every verb taking a backend name refuses an unknown one** — `list`, `upgrade`, `rebuild`
   and `repo`, checked from the code rather than from the one that was reported.
   **Completed 2026-07-29 for the `backend:name` form, which that enumeration missed.** The four
   verbs named above take the backend as a `--backend` flag; the same ruling applies to the verbs
   that take it as a prefix on a package spec, and none of them checked it. Measured after Q9
   shipped: `hold nosuchbackend:foo` **recorded a hold** against a manager that does not exist
   and answered `Held 1 package(s).` at exit 0; `unhold`, `unmanage`, `why`, `upgrade`, `rebuild`,
   `unlock` and `info` each answered a true sentence about the wrong thing at exit 0, and
   `uninstall` blamed the user's modules for a line they never wrote. Every one of those answers
   is byte-identical to what a correctly-spelled name gets when there is nothing to do, which is
   the same indistinguishability that made `list -b <typo>` a defect. All nine refuse now,
   through `StateResolver::require_known_spec_backends`, with the one message.
   *Enumerating a rule over "verbs that take a backend name" and then checking the four that
   take it one way is the shape this register keeps recording: the clause says "from the code",
   and the code has two spellings of the argument.*
2. **One message**, `install`'s, naming the `priority` file and the spelling. Two spellings of
   one refusal is how E18's family started.
3. **A real backend that cannot run here is a different answer.** `flatpak` on a machine
   without flatpak is not a typo — it is a fact about the machine — so it says that and exits
   0. Both used to be the same silence, and only one of them is the user's mistake.

The rule is in **II.8**; the reason is in **V.99**.

## Q10

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q10 — Should the `mix` backend install Hex before installing an archive from it?** **RULED
2026-07-29 (owner): yes — and it asks first, with `--yes` as the flag that forces it.** The
general form of the ruling, given on the same day for all three of Q10, Q11 and Q13: *Shall
should ask whether to do that setup for you, with a flag to force it.*

Measured in the `tools` container, 2026-07-28 and again 2026-07-29. `mix`'s install is
`mix archive.install hex <name> --force`, which fetches an archive from hex.pm. That needs Hex
itself, and mix says so in as many words:

```
$ mix archive.install hex --force phx_new 1.6.16
Could not find Hex, which is needed to build dependency :hex
Shall I install Hex? (if running non-interactively, use "mix local.hex --force")
** (Mix) Could not find an SCM for dependency :hex from Mix.Local.Installer.MixProject
$ mix local.hex --force        -> * creating /root/.mix/archives/hex-2.5.1
$ mix archive.install hex --force phx_new 1.6.16   -> * creating /root/.mix/archives/phx_new-1.6.16
```

**What the ruling is, exactly.** Shall does not install Hex silently and does not merely print
the command. It says what is missing and what it would run, and runs it if you agree —
`--yes` agreeing in advance, which is the same flag that already answers the plan. A
non-interactive run without `--yes` says what it would have asked and changes nothing, because
an installer that runs because a config file said so and nobody was there to look is the risk
the II.12 ledger exists for.

**Where it lives:** `[[prereq]]` rows, shipped compiled-in
(`src/app/apply/prereq_builtins.toml`) and extensible per repo through
`adapters/prereq.toml`, which rides the II.12 ledger like every other `adapters/` file. The
offer runs in II.7's phase 0, right after the bootstrap offer that gets a missing manager.

Two defects were found underneath this one and fixed with it, neither of them Hex's fault:

- **The canary could never have passed.** `mix:hex` was the harness's mix canary, and
  `mix archive.install hex hex` answers `No package with name hex (from: mix.exs) in registry`
  even with Hex present. The Hex defect and an impossible canary were reported as one failure.
- **`mix archive.uninstall` without `--force` prompts**, takes the empty answer from a closed
  stdin, **exits 0 and leaves the archive installed.** Shall reported removals that did not
  happen — the scoop-exit-0 shape (E7), one manager over.

The rule is in **II.7**; the reason is in **V.102**.

---

## Q11

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q11 — What should `opam:` do on a machine with no opam switch?** **RULED 2026-07-29 (owner):
offer to create one, ask first, `--yes` forces it — and `check health` stops calling opam ready
until there is one.** Same ruling as Q10 and Q13, and the same mechanism.

Measured in the `tools` container:

```
$ opam switch show     -> [ERROR] No switch is currently set   (exit 50)
$ opam install -y ocamlfind -> the same error, exit 50
with a switch:  opam switch show -> `default` (exit 0), and the install succeeds.
```

**The compiler is still not chosen for you.** The offered command is
`opam switch create default ocaml-system` — the compiler the machine already has. It is not a
version number, because pinning one is choosing for someone: it fixes the compiler for the
whole account and it is a long build. On a machine with no OCaml at all it fails in four
seconds with opam's own `unmet availability conditions`, which is the point at which the choice
really is the user's and they name one. That is what the earlier recommendation ("report it, do
not create one") was protecting, and asking protects it too.

**The health half is built.** A manager that is installed, answers `list`, and cannot install
anything is reported **degraded** with the reason and the command — not `[READY]`. Degraded
rather than critical: reads genuinely work and the fix is one line. This is the W11 shape
(a backend that reports health and cannot work) applied to a *state* rather than to a missing
binary, and it is checked for manager-level prerequisites only — a per-package one like asdf's
plugin is a question about a declaration, and `check health` has no declarations.

**The `tools` image was also wrong, and that is fixed here.** Its Dockerfile ran
`opam switch create default` with no compiler and swallowed the failure with `|| echo "SKIP
opam init"`, so the image has shipped with no switch since it was written, every opam install
in it failed, and the nightly job read that as an opam defect. It now installs `ocaml-nox`,
creates the switch with `ocaml-system`, and asserts `opam switch show` succeeds — a setup step
nobody checks is a setup step that quietly stops happening.

The rule is in **II.7**; the reason is in **V.102**.

---

## Q12

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q12 — Should the integration sweep fail when its real coverage collapses, and against what
number?** **RULED 2026-07-28 (owner, deferring the threshold to the builder): a ratchet per host
class — record the count, fail when it falls, never when it rises.**

The coverage audit asks whether every registered backend got a lifecycle **or** a plan-smoke,
and a plan-smoke satisfies it. So a run with 4 real lifecycles and a run with 15 both PASS. The
clean Windows sweep reported 4 — not because anything broke, but because 8 of 15 canaries were
already installed on that host and the harness correctly refuses to remove software the user
already had. **The gate's coverage is inversely proportional to how much the machine is used,
and nothing noticed.**

G2 gave this audit a floor for an empty *registry*. It had none for collapsed *lifecycles*.

What is binding:

1. **A ratchet, not a threshold.** The honest number varies by host, and a number guessed once
   is the kind of constant this repo keeps rediscovering was wrong. A ratchet needs no guess: it
   only asserts "this host class did better before, so it can again".
2. **The host class is `<harness>-<os>[-<distro>]-<ci|local>`.** `ci` and `local` are separate
   deliberately — that *is* the difference the finding is about, and holding a developer's box
   to a clean runner's number would make the gate red on every machine that has been used, which
   is how a gate learns to be ignored. The distro is in the key because ubuntu and the `tools`
   image are not comparable runs.
3. **The OS token is normalised.** `uname -s` under git-bash is `MINGW64_NT-10.0-26200`; keying
   on it would mint a fresh host class, and a free pass, at every Windows update.
4. **An unrecorded host class is recorded, not failed.** A gate that fails the first time it
   sees a new platform is a gate that stops people adding platforms.
5. **The numbers live in `scripts/lifecycle-floor.txt`**, with the reasoning beside them, so
   lowering one is a visible line in a diff — the single edit the mechanism exists to expose.
6. **Both harnesses carry it**, native and container. A ratchet on one is the "guard on one
   command" shape again.

The rule is in **IV.1**; the reason is in **V.101**.

---
## Q13

**Status: ANSWERED.**

**Q13 — Should `asdf:` add the plugin a declared tool needs?** **RULED 2026-07-29 (owner): yes,
asking first, `--yes` forces it.** Raised with Q10 and Q11 as one question, because they are one
question: *when a manager needs a setup step before it can install anything, does Shall do it or
print it?*

Measured in the `tools` container (asdf v0.14.1):

```
$ asdf install nodejs latest   -> No such plugin: nodejs      (exit 1)
$ asdf plugin add jq           -> exit 0
$ asdf install jq latest       -> jq 1.8.2 installed!
$ asdf plugin add jq           -> `Plugin named jq already added`, exit 0
```

**This is the row that most needs asking rather than doing, and the owner's ruling gives it
that.** An asdf plugin is a third-party git repository whose shell scripts asdf then executes;
it is not a package download. The offer prints the repository-fetching command before it runs.

Two details the mechanism gets from this row specifically:

- **It is per declared tool, not per manager.** The plugin *is* the package name, so the row is
  offered once per line rather than once per `asdf:`. That is read off the argv (`{name}`), not
  declared beside it, so a row cannot claim one and be written as the other.
- **The probe reads output, not an exit code.** `asdf plugin list` exits 0 and prints
  `No plugins installed`, so an exit-code probe would report every missing plugin as present.
  One line of the output, trimmed, must equal the name — `jq` must not be answered by `jqx`.

The harness canary moved from `nodejs` to `jq` at the same time: both need the plugin, and jq's
downloads one binary in seconds where nodejs fetches a release tarball.

The rule is in **II.7**; the reason is in **V.102**.

## Q14

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-30.**

**Q14 — What should `@unverified` do on a tool version that has no flag to turn verification
off?** Q5 ruled that `@unverified` reaches a manager that verifies signatures itself, and named
helm's `--verify=false`. That flag is **helm 4's**. Measured 2026-07-30 on helm 3.16.2: `helm
plugin install --help` does not document it, `tool_help::accepts_flag` answers `Some(false)`,
Shall withholds it and logs a `tracing::warn!`. GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` ships helm 3, so this is
the ordinary case rather than the exotic one.

Two consequences, both measured rather than argued:

- A `helm:` line carrying `@unverified` is accepted, resolves, and **does nothing**. If helm then
  refuses an unsignable source, the advice names the option the user already wrote.
- **The gate the round-3 grade asked for cannot exist on such a host.** Withholding a correct flag
  and withholding a drifted one are the same action, so no assertion can tell them apart there.
  `tests/grade2_flag_drift_blindspot_tests.rs` — written by the grader, verified green on their
  helm 4.2.3 host and red on a planted mutation — is **red on helm 3**, for a reason that is not
  drift.

The options:

- **(a) Leave it.** The table targets helm 4, the probe adapts, the warning is the notice. Drift in
  `VERIFIES_ITSELF` is then detectable only on a helm-4 machine, and the blindspot gate has to
  become a named skip everywhere else.
- **(b) Refuse the declaration.** `@unverified` on a backend whose installed tool cannot honour it
  is a config error, named in the file, so the option never silently does nothing. But it removes
  the only declaration that installs a helm plugin on helm 3 — which is what Q5's ruling existed
  to make possible.
- **(c) Version-split the behaviour**: emit on 4, refuse on 3.

Not decided in code. The builder's lean is **(b)** — "accepted and does nothing" is the class of
defect this register keeps closing — while noting that (b) is the option that takes a capability
away from a user on the older tool, which is why the choice is the owner's and not the builder's.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-30): none of the three — the question rested on a wrong fact, and it was
measured before it was asked again.** helm 3.21.3's `helm plugin install --help` documents exactly
two flags, `--help` and `--version`. There is no `--verify`, no `--keyring` and no provenance:
**helm 3 does not verify plugins at all.** It verifies *charts* — `helm install --verify` and
`--keyring` are both there — and helm 4 added plugin verification, which is where `--verify=false`
comes from.

So on helm 3 the state `@unverified` asks for is the state the machine is already in. **The line
is accepted, no flag is built, and nothing is said** — not "accepted and does nothing", which is
the defect class this register keeps closing, but *accepted and already true*, which is a correct
no-op. Option (b) would have refused a correct declaration and removed the only way to install a
helm plugin on helm 3 — the capability Q5's ruling existed to create.

**The `warn!` goes.** Withholding a flag the tool never had is not an event, and a warning on a
run that did the right thing is how people learn to stop reading warnings.

**And the drift gate becomes writable rather than impossible.** It asserts the capability table
against what the installed tool does, in *both* directions: a flag in the argv where the tool
verifies, and no flag and no warning where it does not. That can go red on either version.
`tests/grade2_flag_drift_blindspot_tests.rs` asserts the one-directional version and is red on
helm 3 for a reason that was never drift; it is **replaced, not skipped**.

The rule is in **II.2** — the `@unverified` row and the subsection below the option table; the
reason is in **V.104**.

## Q15

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-30.**

**Q15 — Should a command whose whole output is a file it was told to write honour `--dry-run`?**
Measured 2026-07-30, on a fresh config, after the round-4 work made `--dry-run` a property of the
one writer:

- `shall --dry-run bundle --out X` writes **five files** into `X` — `active`, `priority`,
  `modules/starter.txt`, `packages.json`, `plan.json` — byte-identical to the run without the
  flag, and prints `See X/RESTORE.md for offline restore steps.`
- `shall --dry-run plan` writes `shall-plan.json`, the same as `shall plan`.
- `shall --dry-run export --out X` was **not** measured either way: the fixture had no package to
  export, so neither run wrote anything and there was no control.

II.8b says *"a preview writes no file the run would have written"*, and by the letter of it these
are violations. The counter-argument is in the exemption these three carry in
`tests/dry_run_every_verb_tests.rs` — *"writes to a path the user names"* — which is a real
distinction: nothing about the machine changes, the destination was named on the command line,
and `--dry-run plan` producing no plan is a command with no output at all.

The options:

- **(a) Exempt them by rule**, not by an exemption list nobody ruled on: II.8b gains a sentence
  saying a command whose *product* is a file at a path the user named is outside the rule, and
  says which commands those are.
- **(b) Honour the flag everywhere**: `--dry-run bundle` prints what it would write and writes
  nothing; same for `plan` and `export`.
- **(c) Split them**: `plan`'s output *is* its preview, so leave it; `bundle` builds a restore
  artifact and should not build one during a preview.

The builder's lean is **(c)**, and this was deliberately not decided in code: it changes what a
user sees, and the reason `bundle` feels different from `plan` is a judgement about what those
commands are for, which is the owner's to make. What was fixed instead is the half that is not a
judgement — the two verbs that *said* they had written when they had not (`lock`, `heal`).

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-30): (c), the split — and `export` goes with `bundle`.** The line is not
*"did the user name the path"* — they name it for `bundle` too — but **is the file the preview or
the result**.

- `bundle` and `export` produce an artifact that outlives the run and can be carried elsewhere. A
  restore bundle made by a preview is indistinguishable from one made deliberately, and the next
  person to find it cannot tell it was a rehearsal. Both honour the flag: they print what they
  would write, to where, and write nothing.
- `plan`'s file **is** its preview. `--dry-run plan` that wrote nothing would be a command with no
  output — the flag would turn the command off rather than make it safe. It is exempt, and the
  exemption is a rule with a reason rather than a line in a test's exemption list.

`export` was **not measured either way** by the grader — its fixture had no package to export, so
neither run wrote anything and there was no control. It is ruled with `bundle` on the reasoning
above rather than on a measurement, and that is recorded here so the builder measures it rather
than assuming this entry did.

Whatever a preview declines to write, it says so with the `[DRY-RUN]` marker every other verb
uses and never in the past tense — `bundle` printed *"Bundle written to X"* over nine files it
had really written under the flag, which is B-1's defect with the sign flipped.

The rule is in **II.8b**; the reason is in **V.105**.

## Q16

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-30.** Raised by the round-5 grader, measured rather than argued.

**Q16 — Is a bare grammar keyword a package name?** A package name is one bare word (II.2), so a
line containing only `link` is a grammatically valid package declaration — and that is what Shall
makes of it. Measured on a release binary, a module containing the single word `link`:

```
$ shall eval
  "present": [ { "backend": "cargo", "name": "link", "source": "modules/kw.txt:1" } ]
$ shall --dry-run sync -y
  install 1   remove 0   (total 1 change(s))     backends: cargo
$ shall check
  ->  drift   1 to install, 0 to remove, 0 to place, 0 to undo
                 run `shall sync`
```

Thirteen of fourteen keywords behave this way, and each resolves to a real backend holding a real
package of that name — the resolver searched live indexes to produce these:

```
when -> cargo:when      absent -> pip:absent    link  -> cargo:link    service -> cargo:service
setting -> cargo:setting  shim -> scoop:shim    schedule -> cargo:schedule  repo -> cargo:repo
if -> gem:if            else -> npm:else        end -> cargo:end       import -> gem:import
include -> cargo:include                        use  -> refused (the only one)
```

**This is not a parser defect, which is why it is a question.** Written with their punctuation the
same words refuse correctly and legibly — `link:`, `service:`, `shim:`, `when linux`,
`when linux {` all exit 1 with a located `Configuration error`. The ambiguity is confined to the
bare word, and it is a property of the language rather than a bug in the code that implements it.

The cost is that the most likely typo in the format — typing a resource prefix and stopping before
the colon — silently declares a package, and every preview in the program then agrees, because the
model genuinely contains it. `check` recommends the sync. A side effect worth pricing in: resolving
one of these costs 10–27 seconds, since a bare name has no backend and the resolver asks every
manager in priority order; the same fixture with `cargo:ripgrep` is 0.2s.

The options:

- **(a) Reserve them.** A bare word that is a known keyword is a parse error naming the form the
  user probably meant (`link` â†’ *"did you mean `link:PATH`?"*). Costs anyone whose package really is
  called `end` the need to write `cargo:end`.
- **(b) Warn and continue.** Declare it, but say so once per line. Keeps every name declarable and
  puts a sentence between the typo and the install — but a warning on a `sync` that is about to do
  the right thing for everybody else is noise, and V.42's objection to narration applies.
- **(c) Require a backend for a colliding name.** `end` alone is refused; `cargo:end` is accepted.
  This is (a) with an escape hatch, and it is the only option that keeps every package reachable
  while making the typo impossible.
- **(d) Leave it.** The grammar is consistent and II.2 is doing what it says.

The grader's lean is **(c)**. Deliberately not decided in code: it changes what a user sees, it can
remove the ability to declare a package by a bare name, and both are the owner's to rule on.

Red tests are committed and failing: `tests/grade4_keyword_is_not_a_package_tests.rs`, driven off
`known_prefixes()` so a prefix added later is covered without anyone remembering.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-30): (c) — refuse the bare word, and keep every package reachable.** A
line containing only a keyword is a parse error that names both ways to mean it:

```
modules/dev.txt:4: `link` is a keyword, not a package name
  to link a file:                      link:/path/to/source @target=…
  to install a package by that name:   list:link   (or pin one: cargo:link)
```

**The owner asked for a way to still say "make it be a package", and the language already had
one.** A bare `NAME` is defined in II.2 as short for `list:NAME`, so `list:link` means precisely
what the bare form used to. **No quoting is introduced.** Quoting was the obvious shape for an
escape hatch and it is the wrong one here: **V.10** already rejected quotes because `"` needs
`\"` needs `\` needs a newline rule, and nothing about this question disturbs that reasoning.
The ruling adds a refusal and takes nothing away.

It binds the bare **word**, not the prefix — `link:` with its colon and nothing after it was
already a legible refusal and stays exactly as it is.

The rule is in **II.2**; the reason is in **V.103**.

## Q17

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-30.** A follow-on from `Q4`: that ruling made missing coverage
a release blocker, and this one says how the remaining coverage is obtained.

**Q17 — How does a backend that mutates the real machine get its first real lifecycle?**

Twenty of the sixty registered backends had never completed a real install â†’ list â†’ binary â†’
remove in any harness, and twelve of those were in **neither** the canary table nor the
exemption table of either sweep — no coverage and no stated reason. Three of them, `winget`,
`choco` and `psresource`, were excused in writing on the grounds that they *"install machine-wide
on a developer's real machine"*. The excuse did not survive being read next to the rest of the
table: `scoop`, `npm`, `cargo`, `go`, `dotnet` and eleven others install on that same real
machine and have had real lifecycles all along.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-30): install and uninstall them, like everything else.** A disposable
Windows box is not a precondition. The harness already refuses to remove software the host
already had — that guard is what makes this safe, and it is the same guard the other sixteen
managers rely on.

**And privileged containers are authorised** for `lvm`, `zfs` and `btrfs`, which cannot be
exercised any other way: they need real block devices, and a loopback file in a `--privileged`
container is the only disposable way to give them one. These are the destructive effectors, the
code with the most to lose from being wrong, and they were argv-tested and never run.

What binds:

1. **A backend is excused from a lifecycle only for a reason that is *detected*, never assumed.**
   `choco` is skipped when the shell is not elevated and lifecycled when it is; `psresource` is
   skipped when the host has no PSResourceGet cmdlets and lifecycled when it has them. The
   pattern already existed for `pip` and PEP 668 and is now the rule: an assumed skip is a check
   nobody revisits, which is `Q4`'s disclaimer wearing harness clothes.
2. **"It touches the real machine" is not a reason.** Every package manager does. The reason has
   to be something the harness genuinely cannot do — no such userland, no such device, no
   account to sign in with.
3. **Coverage is measured across harnesses, not within one.** Each sweep audited only its own
   registry, so `winget` — excused on Windows and absent from Linux — was examined by nothing
   anywhere. A claim that some *other* image lifecycles a backend is verified on the run of that
   image, so no row can excuse a backend on the strength of a sweep nobody performs.
4. **A platform we do not have is still a release blocker, not an exemption.** `mas` needs a
   signed-in Mac; `pkg`, `pkg_add` and `pkgin` need BSD userlands a Linux container cannot host.
   Those stay counted.

This is a rule about how the project is tested rather than about the program, so it has no Part
II entry — the same shape as `Q4`, whose reason it extends. Its reason is in **V.93**.

## Q18

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised 2026-07-30 by the first run of the storage
backends in the project's history (`Q17`'s privileged image).

**Q18 — The storage backends read options the grammar refuses. Which half of Part II is wrong?**

`lvm:` cannot be written at all. Measured, in a privileged container with a real volume group on
a loopback device:

```
$ shall -y install 'lvm:shallvg/canary@size=64M'
Error: Configuration error: <argument>: `@size` is not an option
  options on a package are: version, hold, expires, until, requires, sha256, formats,
  asset, bin, channel, allow_http, unverified, health, download_only, url, and the
  `*_install` hooks.
```

And without it:

```
Error: `lvm:shallvg/canary` has no `size` — a logical volume needs one to be created,
       e.g. `lvm:shallvg/canary@size=10G`.
```

**The backend's own error message instructs the user to write a line the parser rejects.** There
is no third form. `lvm:` is unusable by construction, and has been since it was written.

**Part II says both things.** II.2's option table (`PACKAGE_OPTION_KEYS` in
`config/grammar/statement.rs`, whose comment cites II.2 as its source) permits fifteen keys and
none of these. The storage paragraph says the opposite in plain words: *"`zfs:tank/data` and
`lvm:vg0/data` join `btrfs:` as declared, sized, mounted objects — Rust, not a `ManagerConfig`,
**because a volume has a size and a mountpoint**, not a version."*

The full extent, from the code rather than from the paragraph:

| backend | options it reads | in II.2's table |
|---|---|---|
| `lvm` | `size` (**required** — install refuses without it) | no |
| `zfs` | `quota`, `mount` | no |
| `btrfs` | `quota`, `mount`, `options` | no |

So `lvm:` is entirely unusable; `btrfs:` and `zfs:` install fine by name and **every documented
option on them is refused**. A declaration that sizes or mounts a volume — the thing the
paragraph says these backends exist for — cannot be written.

**Why this is the owner's and not the builder's.** `CLAUDE.md` rule 4: *anything where Part II
looks wrong — do not fix Part II yourself.* Part II contradicts itself here, and both halves are
implemented. It is also rule 2: whichever way it goes changes what a user may write.

The options:

- **(a) Add them to II.2's table, scoped to the backends that read them.** `@size`, `@quota`,
  `@mount`, `@options` become legal on `lvm:`/`zfs:`/`btrfs:` and are refused by name everywhere
  else — the shape `@url` (U39) and `@download_only` (D3b) already use, with
  `capability::INSTALLS_FROM_SOURCE` as the precedent for one table both the grammar and the
  install path read. Makes the storage paragraph true. Costs one row per option.
- **(b) Delete the option reads from the three backends.** Volumes get created at a default size
  and never mounted or quota'd, which contradicts the storage paragraph and leaves `lvm:` still
  unusable (its size is required by LVM itself, not by Shall).
- **(c) Delete the three backends.** They have never worked and nothing depends on them. `NO
  LEGACY` and *prefer deleting to fixing* both point here, and it is the only option that costs
  nothing to maintain.

**The builder's recommendation was (a)**, scoped by capability rather than globally: the paragraph
already rules that a volume has a size, the mechanism for a backend-scoped option already exists
and is used twice, and `btrfs:` and `zfs:` are otherwise working backends whose only defect is
that half their surface is unreachable. (c) was put to the owner anyway, because "never worked,
nothing depends on it" is the strongest argument this repo recognises.

---

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): (a), and the table is the half that was wrong.** `@size`, `@quota`,
`@mount` and `@mount_options` are legal on the backends that read them and refused by name
everywhere else. The direction given with the ruling binds the shape of it: **broaden so that
everything the code can do can be written — never restrict the code to fit the table.** So the
narrowed form the builder had offered — ship `@size` and `@quota` now, leave `@mount` refused
until the fstab path has been exercised — was **not** taken. `@mount` ships, and the fstab path it
reaches was fixed and given a real lifecycle in the same change rather than left legal on paper.

**`@options` is spelled `@mount_options`.** It is what an fstab entry's option field carries, and
in a flat namespace a key called `options` is a collision waiting for the next feature. Nobody
could have written the old spelling — the parser refused it — so there is nothing to migrate and
no second spelling kept alive.

**The ruling was applied to the whole family, not to the three backends that raised it.** Q18's
real defect is not storage: it is that `PACKAGE_OPTION_KEYS` and the keys backends actually read
were two lists with nothing holding them together. Reading every `options.get(` in the tree found
three more keys in the same state, and all three ship legal here:

| key | read by | what it had been doing |
|---|---|---|
| `classic` | `snap` | `--classic` is how an unconfined snap is installed; the branch had never run |
| `shim` | `sync` | a shim asked for on the tool's own line — **the form `R3` named** when it deleted the imperative `shim` command (2026-07-19) |
| `sandbox` | `sync`, `run` | the same shim, plus confinement for `shall run` |

`R3` is the one that stings. **Measured rather than asserted:** a standalone `shim:NAME` statement
still parsed and is still reconciled (`app/apply/dependents.rs`), so shims were not unmakeable —
the first draft of this entry said they were, and reading the code disproved it. What *was* true
is worse in a quieter way: R3 deleted the imperative command and pointed at `@shim=true` on the
package line as the declarative form, and a different change in the same month closed the option
table into a whitelist that did not contain `shim`. **The ruling pointed at the one form that did
not parse.** Neither change was wrong alone and nothing connected them, which is exactly why the
two lists are now one list with a test across the join (`backends::capability`,
`every_scoped_option_is_a_legal_option_key`).

**What the ruling cost beyond the grammar.** Making `@mount` writable made `btrfs`'s fstab code
reachable for the first time, and it was not fit to be reached: it dropped every fstab line
*containing* the mount point as a substring (so declaring `/mnt` would have deleted `/mnt/data`
and `/mnt/home`), it wrote `subvol=` as the declared path instead of the path from the filesystem
root (the same offset bug `list` was fixed for the day before, mirrored), and removal left the
entry behind — an fstab line naming a subvolume that no longer exists is a machine that stops in
the initramfs. All three are fixed here, with unit tests, and `@mount` now also collapses the
second name it creates for one subvolume so `remove-orphans` cannot offer to destroy a declared
volume under its other path.

**Running it found three defects reading it had not**, all of them in the newly-reachable mount
path: the UUID parser wanted a line *starting* `uuid:` from a report that reads
`Label: none  uuid: …`; the query was put to the **subvolume** when `btrfs filesystem show` only
answers for a filesystem; and `info()` — which is what the planner asks, not `list_installed` —
answered `Path::exists`, so any directory was an installed subvolume and the record it built
carried no properties at all. A half-applied declaration therefore reported itself satisfied for
ever, so a declared `@mount=` that does not match the machine is drift now, decided beside
`@version` and `@channel`.

**And the harness stopped being deliberately red.** The `lvm:VG/LV@size=64M` canary that failed
by name every run now passes; `btrfs`'s canary carries `@quota` and `@mount` so the fstab path
has a real lifecycle on a real device rather than a legal spelling. `lvm` then failed once more
for a reason that was **not** Shall — `device not cleared`, reproduced with a hand-run
`lvcreate`, because the image's udev workaround `sed`-ed keys Ubuntu ships commented out and the
`grep` meant to verify it matched the comments and passed. Fixed in the image, and 13c now
probes with a real volume before claiming lvm has a canary. The storage job moves to the fast
matrix, which is what its own comment said to do the moment this was ruled.

**Final measurement, on real block devices: `pass=274 fail=0 soft=7`.** The image's
real-lifecycle floor goes 3 → 5 — apt, github, btrfs, cargo, lvm. `zfs:` is still not among
them and is not excused: this kernel ships no ZFS module, which `Q4` counts as a release
blocker. So `@quota` and `@mount` are proven on btrfs and `@size` on lvm; on `zfs:` they are
argv-tested and read the same options through the same table, and that is the honest limit of
what has been run.

---

## Q19

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised the same day by building `Q18`: the keys were
writable and applied, and nothing decided what a *changed* one meant.

**Q19 — When a declared size changes, does Shall resize the volume?**

`@mount` converges: a declared mountpoint that does not match the machine is drift, and `sync`
re-applies it (that shipped with `Q18`, because a mount that silently never happened was the
defect being fixed). **`@quota` and `@size` do not.** Editing `@quota=100M` to `200M`, or
`@size=10G` to `20G`, changes nothing on the next sync — the volume is present under its name,
so there is no drift to act on.

Two questions, and they are not the same size:

- **`@quota` on `btrfs:`/`zfs:` is safe to re-apply.** `btrfs qgroup limit` and `zfs set quota=`
  are idempotent property writes, and lowering a quota below current usage is refused by the tool
  rather than destroying anything. The only real work is comparing a declared `100M` against a
  reported byte count without a normalisation bug — and a wrong comparison here has a specific
  failure mode worth naming: **every sync reports a change for ever**, which is exactly what D13
  warned about when it required a *readable* current value.
- **`@size` on `lvm:` is not.** Honouring it means `lvextend` to grow — and its mirror image,
  `lvreduce` to shrink, **destroys data** unless the filesystem is shrunk first, which Shall
  does not do and should probably never do unattended. So this is not "add a comparison"; it is
  a decision about whether a declaration may resize a filesystem at all, and whether shrinking
  is refused by name.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): it edits — and where editing can lose data, the line has to say
so.** A declaration is the machine's description of itself, so an edited `@quota` or `@size` is
drift like any other and `sync` converges it. The owner declined the half of the recommendation
that refused shrinking outright: shrinking is *allowed*, behind a flag, because the register's
job is to record what the user decided and not to decide it for them. What the flag buys is that
nobody shrinks a filesystem by editing a number and pressing enter.

**The rule, as built:**

- **`@quota` re-applies** on `btrfs:` and `zfs:`. Idempotent property writes; lowering one below
  current usage is the tool's refusal to make, not ours.
- **`@size` resizes on `lvm:`.** Bigger runs `lvextend --resizefs`. Smaller is **refused unless
  the line carries `@allow_shrink=true`**, and the refusal names the actual size, the declared
  size, and the way out.
- **`--resizefs` on both directions, never a bare `lvreduce`.** It shrinks the filesystem before
  the volume, so the bytes given up are ones nothing is using — which is what makes the flag a
  permission to *resize* rather than a permission to truncate. A filesystem that cannot shrink
  (xfs) fails there, before the volume is touched.
- **`@allow_shrink` without `@size` is a parse error**, the same one level in `@mount_options`
  gets: a line that reads "shrinking is allowed here" while nothing can shrink is worse than a
  line that does nothing, because someone will believe it.

**The comparison is by value, in bytes, and only the declared side is ever parsed.** Every tool
is asked for raw bytes — `zfs list -p`, `lvs --units b --nosuffix`, `btrfs qgroup show --raw` —
so `@quota=10240M` against a reported `10737418240` is not a change. `D13`'s failure mode was the
one to design against here: a comparator that had to reconcile `10.00GiB`, `10.00g` and `10G`
reports a change on every sync, for ever.

**Three states, not two.** A byte count is a limit; `none` is a backend that looked and found no
limit, which against a line declaring one is drift; **no property at all** is a backend that
could not look, and that is left alone. Reading "could not read" as "no limit" is how a quota
gets re-applied on every sync for ever; reading it as "satisfied" is how one never gets applied
at all.

**The sibling this fix would have shipped past.** `@mount` used to `return` out of the drift
check, so a line carrying both a mount and a quota had only the mount looked at — the second
option was dead the moment anyone wrote the two together, which is the ordinary way to write
them. The facets are OR-ed now. `@mount_options` was dead the same way and converges too: a
changed option field rewrites the fstab entry, where before it kept yesterday's options through
every sync and every reboot.

**Run, not argued — on a real logical volume, `docker/integration/run-in-container.sh` §14b.**
The storage image goes **`pass=274 fail=0 soft=7` â†’ `pass=279 fail=0 soft=7`**, and the five are
these; the real-lifecycle ratchet holds at 5 â‰¥ 5 (`btrfs`, `lvm` both on real devices, `zfs`
still short a kernel module):

```
PASS  lvm: a bigger @size grew shallvg/resizer, 67108864 -> 134217728 bytes
PASS  lvm: a second sync over the same declaration left the volume alone
PASS  lvm: a smaller @size is refused by name and the volume is untouched at 134217728 bytes
PASS  lvm: @allow_shrink shrank shallvg/resizer, 134217728 -> 67108864 bytes
PASS  lvm: the resize canary uninstalls
```

The edit is made **in the module file and applied by `sync`**, never by re-running `install` —
`install` hands a named spec to the backend, so it would prove the resize argv and skip the half
that was broken, which was the planner deciding a volume already present under its name still
needs work. **The second line is the one that could not be got any other way:** D13's failure
mode is a comparison that reports a change on every sync for ever, and a harness that syncs once
cannot see it. `btrfs:` and `zfs:` did not run here — the kernel that run borrowed had neither
module — so `@quota` re-apply is argv-and-unit-tested and not yet executed. **The `zfs:` half of
that sentence stopped being about Q4's release blocker on 2026-08-18**: the `storage` leg drives
a real `zfs` install â†’ list â†’ uninstall â†’ gone in CI (run 32132445664), which empties the set Q4
counts. What remains here is narrower and still true — that leg creates and destroys a pool, so
the *re-apply* of `@quota` on a dataset that already carries one is not what it measures.

**Deleting the option is not declaring "no limit".** A line that drops `@quota=` stops declaring
a quota; it does not ask for the existing one to be lifted. That is the same reading `@mount`
already has — an option nobody wrote is an option nobody is managing — and the opposite reading
would make removing a word from a config file silently uncap a filesystem.

**What is not covered.** `lvm:` grows through `fsadm`, so a volume carrying **no** filesystem
fails loudly rather than growing silently — the honest limit of resizing by declaration, and
better than applying half of one. And a resize appears in the preview as an install of the
object, the same shape `@mount` and `@channel` already take; a `Resize` node of its own would be
a fourth spelling of "this line needs work" threaded through the guard, the transaction and the
preview.

## Q20

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised the same day by `Q19`'s sibling sweep: the fix
for storage geometry found the identical defect on `snap:`, and the owner ruled it the same way
in the same session.

**Q20 — When `@classic` changes, does Shall re-confine the snap?**

`@classic` is read in exactly one place: when the install argv is built. So a snap that gains the
option *after* it was installed stays strictly confined for ever — `snap list` shows the name,
the planner finds nothing to do, and `sync` reports success over a declaration it never applied.
That is `Q19` word for word with a different noun, which is why it was found by looking for
siblings rather than by anyone hitting it.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): yes, the same.** An edited `@classic` is drift and `sync` converges
it.

**But the two directions are not symmetric, and snapd is what makes them asymmetric.**
`snap refresh --classic` relaxes confinement in place; **there is no switch that narrows it
back.** The only way from classic to strict is remove-and-reinstall — a removal, of a package the
user declared, to satisfy an option. That is the guard's decision and not a backend's, so:

- **`@classic=true` on a strictly-confined snap** â†’ `snap refresh --classic`. Automatic, and
  nothing is destroyed.
- **`@classic=false` on a classic snap** â†’ **refused by name**, with the message saying snapd
  cannot narrow confinement and naming the by-hand path. The same shape as `Q19`'s shrink
  refusal, and for the same reason: the direction that removes something says so out loud.
- **No `@classic` at all** â†’ **unmanaged**, exactly as a dropped `@quota` is. A line that says
  nothing about confinement is not asking for strict, so it can never schedule that removal. This
  is what keeps the refusal above from firing on configs nobody edited.

**The sibling inside the sibling.** `@channel`'s drift check `return`ed from the function, so a
snap carrying a channel *and* `@classic` had only the channel looked at — the identical fault
`Q19` fixed for `@mount`, in the branch immediately above it, found because the fix for one was
being written next to the other. Both are folded into one accumulator now. The argv had the
matching bug: the refresh was built from `@channel` alone, so a line asking for both changes
would have dropped one. One refresh carries both switches.

**And `snap info` is now read once.** `is_installed` asked `snap list` and `current_channel`
asked `snap info` for facts printed on the same page of the same report — two subprocesses per
snap per sync, and two answers that could disagree across the gap between them. Presence is the
`installed:` line, not the exit code: `snap info` answers just as happily for a snap that only
exists in the store, and reading that as installed would send every first install down the
refresh path.

**Not run.** No image here has a working snapd — a container cannot run it — so this is argv- and
unit-tested against real `snap info` output and has never been executed. It is named that way
rather than counted, exactly as `zfs:` is.

## Q21

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised by `Q19` and `Q20` landing in the same session
from the same cause, which is the definition of a class rather than two bugs.

**Q21 — Must every option a backend reads converge when it changes?**

`Q19` found four options applied at creation and never again (`@quota`, `@size`, `@mount`,
`@mount_options`). `Q20` found a fifth on a different backend (`@classic`) by asking the rest of
the tree the same question. Neither was reported by a user; both were found by looking. **The
question is therefore not about those five — it is whether "an option changes the machine when
you change it" is a property of every option, or a thing five options happen to have.**

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): every option, and the builder proves it per option.** An option a
backend reads is a declaration; a declaration that stops applying the moment it is first applied
is the defect `Q18` existed to prevent, arriving one layer in. So:

- **Changing an option changes the machine**, or the line is refused with a reason. There is no
  third outcome, and "nothing happens" is not one of them.
- **The proof is per option, not per backend.** A lifecycle is install â†’ list â†’ remove, which by
  construction never edits a declaration — which is exactly why all five sat dead through
  thousands of green checks. A backend with a real lifecycle is *not* covered for this.
- **Where the change cannot be applied, it is refused by name** with the by-hand path
  (`Q19`'s shrink, `Q20`'s narrowing), never ignored.
- **An option the line omits manages nothing.** Absence is not a declaration of the default, or
  every existing config acquires refusals it never asked for (`V.107`, `V.108`).

**In the tree today: NOT swept.** The five named above converge and are tested. Every other
option a backend reads is unaudited against this rule — `PACKAGE_OPTION_KEYS` and
`capability.rs`'s tables are the list to work from, and the work is in `plan.md`'s Tier 0. The
grader carries the same sweep as §3.5, because it is the check and this entry is the obligation.

## Q22

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised by the round-8 builder after reading `shall eval`
on a module saved the way Windows saves files.

**Q22 — A config file that begins with a byte-order mark: refuse it, or read it?**

Notepad writes UTF-8 **with** a BOM by default, and so does PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content
-Encoding utf8` — the editor and the shell this project is developed in. The three bytes are an
encoding artefact: no editor displays them, and the user has no way to see what is wrong.
Shall took them as part of the first name on the first line:

```text
$ shall eval
Error: .../modules/starter.txt:1: `<U+FEFF>cargo` is not a backend Shall uses
  add `<U+FEFF>cargo` to your `priority` file, or check the spelling.
```

Two names that render identically, and advice the user has already followed. The alternative to
reading the file was refusing it by name — *"this file begins with a byte-order mark; save it as
UTF-8 without one"* — which is loud, honest, and makes every Windows user's first config fail.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): read it.** A leading BOM is stripped where config text enters a
parser, for every file: modules, profiles, `priority`, `active`, `vars`, `schedules`,
`preferences.toml` and the settings file. The rule is II.1's, the reason is `V.112`.

**Only the mark, and only at the start.** A U+FEFF anywhere else in a line is a zero-width
character that nothing but a paste puts there, and it is still refused by name — stripping every
occurrence would be the silent repair this codebase exists as a reaction to. The refusal names
the codepoint rather than drawing it, which is the same session's fix to `GrammarError`.

**Where it is applied is part of the ruling.** At the parser, not at the read: `model/edit.rs`
reads the same files in order to rewrite them, and II.16 says Shall must not rewrite your files
— which includes their encoding. A file that arrived with a mark keeps it.



## Q23

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-07-31.** Raised by CI: both `Build` jobs were red on
`tests/grade2_info_tests.rs`, on two platforms, for one cause.

**Q23 — Is an `@` that opens a package name part of the name, or the start of the options?**

npm's scoped packages are named `@scope/name` — `@angular/cli`, `@vue/cli`, `@bazel/bazelisk` —
and `npm ls -g` prints them, so `shall list` reports them. Writing one back was impossible:

```text
$ shall info npm:@bazel/bazelisk
Error: `@bazel/bazelisk` is not a list of `key=value` options
  commas need the block form.
```

`@` introduces an option (`@version=1.2`), so a name starting with `@` was read as an empty name
followed by nonsense options. **A name Shall lists has to be a name Shall accepts**, and the
error was advice about a mistake nobody had made.

**RULED (owner, 2026-07-31): the leading `@` is part of the name.** Only the first character of
the name is special; every later `@` still opens the options, so `npm:@angular/cli@version=17.3.0`
is a pinned scoped package. Nothing existing can break — a line beginning `npm:@...` did not
parse, so no config anywhere contains one. Rule in II.2, reason in **V.113**.

**The owner also named a fallback and it is deliberately NOT built:** *"if it gets confusing, we
can have them quote it."* Quoting was rejected once as **V.10** — a quote needs an escape, which
needs a backslash rule, which needs a newline rule — so it stays a decision to be re-argued
rather than a convenience to be assumed. Nothing today is ambiguous enough to need it: the rule
is positional, and there is exactly one special position.

## Q24

**Status: ANSWERED — built 2026-08-02, ruled 2026-08-10.** The owner said *"find the shall bug
(not just symptom but root) and fix"*, which ruled that a bound must exist. It did not rule the
number, and the number is the whole cost of being wrong in either direction.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): the user sets it, and the default is the builder's call.** The
numbers stand — **900s for a mutation, 120s for a read** — and the reason for keeping 900 rather
than lowering it is worth writing down, because the instinct was to lower it:

- **The costs are asymmetric.** Killing a package manager that was legitimately working in
  silence leaves a half-applied install; waiting too long on a hang costs minutes. A large MSI
  under `winget`, or `Checkpoint-Computer`, can genuinely print nothing for a long time, and no
  wall-clock number distinguishes that from a wedge. When one direction breaks a machine and the
  other wastes time, the number belongs on the side that wastes time.
- **The bound that actually fires is already tight and already measured.** `Q32` split reads out
  as `query_idle_timeout_secs`, sized at 120s against a cold `winget list` at 2.6s under
  sixteen-way contention — about 46× the worst observed. A wedged *question* costs two minutes,
  not fifteen, and questions are what wedge.
- **The fifteen-minute hangs the owner was actually seeing were not this bound doing its job.**
  They were `S88`: sudo waiting on `/dev/tty` for a password nobody was going to type, running out
  the clock. Lowering the mutation bound would have made that hang cheaper while leaving it a
  hang. Fixing `S88` removed it.

So the ceiling stays where a legitimately slow command survives it, and the sharp numbers live on
the two bounds that can be sized from measurements: reads, and now the sudo prompt.

**Q24 — How long may a command say nothing before Shall stops waiting for it?**

`shall -y uninstall choco:bat` ran 76 minutes and removed nothing. The child was
`Checkpoint-Computer`; Windows event 8194 records the restore point created **18 seconds in**, and
the process then emitted nothing at all for the remaining 76 minutes without exiting. Nothing in
Shall bounded it: the only timeout in the tree wraps the transaction DAG, and snapshots, state
reads, guards and `plan` all run outside it. Two earlier hangs (`gem:colorize` at eight minutes,
`github:sharkdp/fd` at fifteen) were killed by hand and recorded as undiagnosed; the fix then went
into the *harness*, not the product.

**The shape is settled and is not what needs a ruling.** The bound is on **silence, not
duration** — a working `cargo install` prints for an hour and must never be touched, and no
wall-clock cap can be set above that and below a hang. Rule in II.12, reason in **V.114**.

**What is built, pending confirmation:**

- `command_idle_timeout_secs`, default **900**, `0` removes the bound.
- 900 because the adversarial case is a command that is legitimately silent for its whole run —
  `Checkpoint-Computer` is exactly that — so the number has to clear a real one. It is a
  judgement, not a measurement: **nobody has measured the longest legitimate silence in Shall's
  own workload.** The observed hang was 76 minutes and the observed real snapshot was 18 seconds,
  which brackets it loosely and no better than that.
- Killing is `Retryability::Permanent`. Retrying spends another full bound per attempt on a
  command that has already proved it does not finish, and three silences teach the user nothing
  the first did not.

**What could reverse it:** a lower default (a hang costs less, a slow silent command breaks), or
per-class bounds keyed to `latency.rs`'s `Class` (a read bounded in seconds, a mutation in the
quarter hour) — which is better and is not built, because the classes describe Shall's own verbs
and the bound is per *child process*.

## Y1

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-02.** Raised by `docs/INEFFICIENCIES.md`, measured with
counting shims around each manager binary rather than argued.

**Y1 — Does Shall put several packages on one manager command line?** It did not. Every install
and every removal was its own DAG node and every node called its backend with a one-element
slice, so installing 50 apt packages was 50 `apt-get install <one>` invocations. Measured in a
disposable Ubuntu container: six declared packages produced six `apt` processes and 12,465 ms,
against 3,161 ms for `apt install` of *eight* packages as one command. One at a time, the same
packages scaled 1 â†’ 2,131 ms, 2 â†’ 4,017 ms, 4 â†’ 7,372 ms, 8 â†’ **31,901 ms**.

**RULED: batch.** Everything ready at the same moment, for the same manager, with no edge
between any two of them, goes on one command line. Rule in **II.19**, reason in **V.115**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- A dependency edge splits the wave; an install and a removal are two commands. *(Amended by
  `Y9`, 2026-08-06: the only such edges are the `@requires` a user wrote. The planner used to
  manufacture them by asking each backend what a declared package depends on, which is why the
  case where Shall knew two packages were related was the case it refused to batch.)*
- The line is bounded — 100 names or 6000 bytes, whichever comes first — because `cmd.exe` caps
  a command line at 8191 characters and every manager has some limit.
- **Rollback granularity is unchanged.** What each package looked like before is still captured
  per package, before the command runs, and the compensation loop still walks per package. A
  batch that fails fails every package in it, which is what a single node failure already meant:
  any failure rolls the whole transaction back.
- The WAL still records per package, before the manager is invoked.
- `before_install` still fires per package and a failing one takes that package out of the batch
  rather than out of the run.
- **The telemetry says when packages shared a command.** Several packages reporting the same
  duration to the millisecond was previously the signature of a fully serialised run reported
  under a heading reading `Parallel Task Breakdown`; it is now the signature of a batch, and the
  line says which.

**What could reverse it:** a manager that mis-reports which package in a batch failed, making a
failure less locatable than it was. None found in the sixteen hand-written backends, all of which
already accept multiple names.

---

## Y2

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-02.**

**Y2 — Is one concurrency number enough?** `max_parallel` was doing three jobs: CPU/process
fan-out, transaction concurrency, and pure network fan-out. It defaults to the core count, which
is right for the first two and arbitrary for the third — on a four-core laptop `shall search` ran
its ~22 registry queries in six sequential waves.

**RULED: split the knob, do not remove it.** `max_parallel` stays the process knob (owner ruling
2026-07-17 kept it as a user-settable cap). **`network_parallel`** is new, defaults to **16**
regardless of cores, and bounds concurrent network requests. Rule in **II.19**, reason in
**V.116**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- Nothing that fans out reads a third number. The three hardcoded caps — `installed_sets`'s 8,
  the health probe's 4, `TransactionConfig::patient`'s 4 — read a knob now.
- Where two fan-outs nest, the cap is held by the leaf that talks to the network, so they do not
  multiply.
- **`upgrade` fans out across the managers that contend with nothing.** The `needs_root()` set
  stays strictly sequential; `cargo`, `npm`, `pipx`, `uv`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `vscode`, `emacs`,
  `krew` and `go` overlap. This narrows a rule recorded in `history.md:2055` to the case its
  reason actually covers.
- **Variables resolve once per invocation** — which II.6b already required and the code did not
  do. Measured: one `shall check` ran the user's `vars.sh` three times.

**What could reverse it:** a registry that reads 16 concurrent queries as abuse. The default is a
judgement, not a measurement, and it is a key precisely so a machine can say otherwise.

---

## Y3

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-02.**

**Y3 — May a read-only command give up on a backend that will not answer?** `search` had no
per-backend deadline, so its latency was the maximum over ~22 registries rather than the median:
one rate-limited GitHub call set the whole runtime, and the command measured 15.5s / 25.5s /
48.0s / 160.2s across four runs. `check health` had already answered this question for its own
probe, with the reasoning for its number written beside it.

**RULED: yes, and it says so.** A backend that has not answered within twice the configured
network timeout (floor 30s) contributes nothing to a search and is named in the "backends that
failed and were skipped" line. Rule in **II.19**, reason in **V.117**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- A `@health=` port probe gives up after 5s. A *closed* localhost port refuses immediately, but a
  **filtered** one — which `apply/firewall.rs` can itself create — waits out the OS default:
  ~21s on Windows, ~130s on Linux, while deciding whether to roll a sync back.
- **A download still carries no whole-request timeout.** A release asset can legitimately take an
  hour, and a bound sized for an API call turns a slow link into a corrupt install. Where a wait
  is deliberately unbounded, that is stated rather than left to be inferred.

**What could reverse it:** a legitimately slow registry that a user needs and that now reports as
having failed. The alternative is the command that took 160 seconds without saying why.

---

## Y4

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-02.**

**Y4 — Must the pre-sync restore point finish before anything else starts?** It was awaited as a
barrier before any work, and on Windows it is `Checkpoint-Computer` — measured at **50.8s**, with
no faster API to swap to. So every install and every uninstall on Windows paid a fixed ~51-second
tax in front of work that had to happen anyway, and **nothing in the output said it was
happening**, so the pause read as a hang. It was reported as one, twice, and killed by hand both
times.

**RULED: it starts first and is joined last, and it announces itself.** The snapshot begins
before the read-only pre-flight and is joined immediately before the first mutating command —
which is the whole requirement, since a snapshot taken after the change would revert to the
change. Rule in **II.19**, reason in **V.118**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- A refused sync aborts it, so a refusal leaves nothing half-taken.
- The snapshot provider's PowerShell passes `-NoProfile -NonInteractive`. It passed neither; a
  user's profile ran on every snapshot operation. `psresource.rs` and `executor.rs` had passed
  `-NoProfile` all along, and this was the third of three.
- **The write-ahead journal is `journal.jsonl`**, one JSON value per line, appended. It used to
  re-serialise the entire map, pretty printed, through a temp file and a rename, on every state
  change — O(n²) bytes in the number of actions, under the one mutex every concurrent DAG worker
  has to take, which made it a throttle that got worse as `Y1` widened the graph. A pre-existing
  `journal.json` is not read: under NO LEGACY there is no old-format reader, and a wholly
  unreadable WAL is still moved aside and named rather than swallowed (S10).

**What could reverse it:** a snapshot provider whose work is not safe to overlap with reads. All
three built-in providers and the config-driven one only read while creating.

---

## Y5

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised by the owner while asking whether Shall was fast
enough to adopt, and the question could not be answered from inside Shall.

**Y5 — Does Shall say where its own time went?** It did not. `latency.rs` measured the *total*
and warned when a class crossed its budget — enough to notice the 98-second `info` (E14), and
not enough to act on one, because the next question is always *which manager*. Answering it
meant timing each manager by hand outside Shall and subtracting, which is how an afternoon gets
spent proving that a 3.2-second `list` is 2.35 seconds of `winget list` and 0.8 seconds of
everything else. `-vv` printed a running commentary with no durations in it.

**RULED: `--timings`, off by default, on stderr.** It reports the wall clock, the summed child
time, and the ratio between them, then every child command slowest first. Rule in **II.19**,
reason in **V.119**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- **The ratio is the point, not the list.** Shall's whole design is overlapping other people's
  processes, so 19.52s of child time inside a 3.15s wall clock — 6.2× — is the claim `Y1`–`Y3`
  make, stated as a number the user can check on their own machine. A breakdown printing only
  a sorted list would show the same seconds and hide whether any of them were overlapped.
- **Recording is off unless asked for.** A measurement nobody requested is the eager work this
  whole round exists to delete.
- **stderr, never stdout.** `shall eval --timings | jq` still gets JSON.
- **Instrumented at the choke point**, `CommandExecutor::run_on` — the one call every manager
  invocation funnels through — rather than per verb. A budget every verb has to remember to
  check is the shape `latency.rs` already rejected.
- **The one automatic probe that spawns outside that choke point is instrumented too**
  (`psresource`'s PowerShell cmdlet check, and the external `vars` providers). Interactive
  children are deliberately left out: `shall shell`, the history pager, `bisect`'s test command
  and `setup`'s installer are the user's own program in the foreground, and a duration for
  "how long you sat in your shell" is not a fact about Shall.
- The label is the program and its **first argument** — `winget list`. Keyed by full argv, an
  install would produce one row per package instead of one row per thing the run waited on.

**What could reverse it:** a per-child JSON emission (a `--timings=json`) if anything ever wants
to gate on these numbers in CI. Deliberately not built now — nothing consumes it, and
`lifecycle-floor.txt` is the standing argument against a threshold nobody measured.

---

## Y6

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised by the owner: *"it should cache optionally."*

**Y6 — May a manager's answer outlive the run that asked for it?** `Y1`–`Y5` took every
question Shall asks in one run down to one ask, overlapped: `shall list` puts 19.5 s of manager
work into ~3.2 s, 6.2Ã—, and the floor is `winget list` at 2.35 s. There is nothing left to
overlap. The next `shall list` then asks all 24 managers the same question again, about a
machine that in the ordinary case nothing has touched since.

**RULED: yes, and off by default.** `installed_cache_secs` (0 = never) reuses a manager's
installed listing across runs. Measured on this Windows box: **3.99 s â†’ 0.68 s**, with one child
command surviving instead of 24. Rule in **II.19**, reason in **V.120**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- **Off by default, and that is the ruling, not caution.** Every other speed-up in II.19 costs
  nothing but concurrency. This one costs *correctness* when it is wrong, and being wrong about
  the machine is how a declarative tool removes something it should not have. The user turns it
  on for their machine, knowing their machine.
- **Any mutation drops it**, on disk as well as in memory. `forget_all` clears both, because an
  invalidation that clears the memo and leaves the file is an invalidation that does nothing —
  the next question re-reads the pre-mutation answer straight off disk. Third time this repo has
  found that shape (the guard's tenth removal path, the run-scoped memos, this).
- **`--no-cache` bypasses it for one run**, and `shall clean-cache` forgets it outright — the
  latter unconditionally, since the files may have been written by a run that had it on.
- **It answers a command that reports, and never one that writes its answer down.** `list`,
  `search`, `check`, `outdated`, `info`, `why` — an allowlist, so a command added later has to
  say it is a reader. The setting says how long a *reading* may be reused; it never said a plan
  or an adoption may be built on one. A `sync` planned from a listing taken before the user
  removed something by hand skips the install and reports success, which is a declared package
  left absent with nothing saying so — the exact class the "off by default" clause above is
  about, and turning the setting on must not buy it. **V.120a.**
- **Written per manager, through a temp file and renamed, and the temp name carries the pid.**
  A half-flushed listing read back is a *shorter* machine, and a shorter machine is a list of
  things to remove. The rename is only atomic per writer: two runs sharing one temp path — a
  shell prompt hook and a terminal — write into each other's file and rename the interleaving,
  which is that same torn listing arrived at by the mechanism meant to prevent it.
- **Every read failure is a miss, never an error.** Corrupt, unreadable, or a clock that moved
  backwards all mean "ask the manager", never "this machine is empty".

**What could reverse it:** a cheap per-manager change token — `dpkg` status mtime, winget's
own database timestamp — which would let a listing be validated rather than merely aged, and
would make an on-by-default cache defensible. Not built: it is one investigation per manager,
and the TTL is the honest version of what is actually known today.

---

## Y7

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised by the owner: *"we need a way to declare all of
winget's things."*

**Y7 — How is a package name with a space in it written?** It was not. `winget list` answers
with `ARP\Machine\X64\Mozilla Firefox` — the identifier `winget install` takes back — and the
grammar's *a package name is one word* refused it. `adopt` held such names back and said *"its
manager reports a name no package line can hold"*, which was true and was a wall.

**The measurement corrected the diagnosis twice.** The backslashes were already accepted —
`2c51968` had taught the grammar and the validator about them. On this machine the names Shall
could not write were **161: six winget names, every one of them a name with a space, and 155
`service:` names that are not a package-line question at all** (see below). The 185-backslash
figure in `docs/archive/GRADE-2026-07-31.md` §5 G-2 describes a defect that no longer exists.

**RULED: quote it.** `winget:"ARP\Machine\X64\Mozilla Firefox"`. Rule in **II.19**, reason in
**V.121**. After it, **zero** names winget reports on this machine are undeclarable, and the
manifest `adopt` writes parses.

**What the ruling binds:**

- **Quoting is what keeps VI.1 shut.** *An unrecognised line is an error* (II.2) rests on prose
  not being a package name. Prose is not quoted, so `apt:this is just prose` is still an error
  while `winget:"Mozilla Firefox"` is a name.
- **The quotes are syntax, not name.** What round-trips is what was inside them.
- **An `@` inside the quotes belongs to the name**; the options still open at the first `@`
  after the closing quote. `npm:@scope/pkg@version=1.2` is untouched.
- **One function decides both whether a name can be written and how it is spelled**
  (`grammar::declarable_line`). They were the same question asked in two places — a check that
  round-tripped `backend:name` and a writer that rendered it by hand — which is exactly how the
  grammar could learn to quote while `adopt` went on emitting the unquoted form and producing a
  manifest that does not parse. That is `2c51968`'s bug in the other direction, closed before it
  could happen rather than after.
- **The validator learned the space with the grammar.** V.113 is that a name is admitted by a
  grammar *and* a validator; a rule that admits the backslash and stops at the space carries
  most of an identifier and not the one the user has.

**The message is fixed; what it was hiding is still open.** 155 of the 161 held-back names were
`service:` lines, and the reason printed for them was wrong: `service:AppMgmt` parses perfectly.
`is_declarable` accepted only `Statement::Package`, and `service:` is its own statement kind, so
every service failed a test about package lines and was reported as an unwritable *name*. The
grammar answers three ways now — `Declared::Package` / `Resource` / `Nothing` — and `adopt` gives
each held-back name the reason that is true of it.

**The question under it is `Y7a`, ruled below.**

**What could reverse it:** nothing found. The alternative — taking everything after the colon
as the name — was rejected: it re-opens VI.1, and it makes `@` unusable as the option separator
on the most common line in the language.

---

## Y7a

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** *Should `adopt` take Windows services at all?* Owner:
*"services too get put in with no comment, just like packages. You can guard it, but you need
not."*

**RULED: adopt them as live lines.** Rules in **II.19**, reason in **V.124**.

**What the ruling binds:**

- **A service is a line like any other.** `service:AppMgmt@status=running`, uncommented, next to
  the packages. Deleting it stops and disables the service, and the manifest header says that in
  those words rather than in the word *uninstall*, which was true of every line before this.
- **The owner's argument was the load-bearing one, and it is now written down as V.124.**
  `purge-unmanaged` builds its list from `list_installed`, which for `service` is every running
  service — so all 155 were already sweep candidates, refused only because `protection_of` opened
  with *could a package line hold this name?* and a service line is not a package line. Declaring
  them makes them managed, and the sweep only takes what is not. The guard need not carry them.
- **It carries them anyway, on purpose.** A service started after an adopt is unmanaged again.
  `Protection::NotAPackage` refuses that by a rule about resources instead of by an accident about
  package names — the accident being one honest tidy-up away from handing the sweep 155 services.
- **The line carries what was observed, and no more.** A bare `service:` line means *enable and
  start*, and enable on Windows rewrites the start type to automatic. The init reports only
  *running* services, so `status=running` is the whole of what was seen. `adoption_options` is the
  seam; it is empty for every package backend.
- **The register's other half stays as it is.** `service::list_manual` still answers with the
  running set and `tracks_manual()` stays `true`. That is what this ruling makes correct: the
  question `adopt` asks a resource backend is *what state is this machine in*, not *what did you
  choose*, and `manual_source` now says so in the manifest instead of claiming user intent.

**What could reverse it:** the asymmetry between what an adopted line declares
(`status=running`) and what deleting it does (stop **and** disable). It predates the ruling and is
disclosed rather than narrowed; narrowing removal to match the declared options would be a change
to Q7's teardown rule and is the owner's, not this ruling's.

## Y8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised by the owner: *"identify why it did not
parallelize properly and fix that."*

**Y8 — Why did a run with 33 child commands and 20 slots still go in waves?** Not because
anything was slow. `check drift` on a 298-package config took **9.13 s** to do about 2.3 s of
critical path, and the `--timings` breakdown named the reason directly: nine managers — gem,
pip, emacs, luarocks, dotnet, dart, nimble, bun, service — **started at 5.4 s**, and nothing at
all was running for the second before they did. Y5 built the instrument that could say that; it
is the first question here answered by reading Shall's own report rather than by guessing.

**Two faults, one shape.**

- **The report asks each manager when its section gets to it.** `check` plans drift, then crawls
  for unmanaged packages, then probes health. The crawl wants every manager on the machine; the
  plan wants the nine that are declared. So fifteen managers waited out a plan that had no
  question for them — and every one was going to be asked before the command could answer.
- **The plan's fan-out is over specs, not managers.** A spec's answer comes from its manager's
  whole listing, so 256 winget declarations put 256 futures in a queue `max_parallel` slots
  wide, every one waiting on the same `winget list`, while scoop, choco and cargo went unasked
  for want of a slot. Measured: three managers at 0.3 s, the other six at 1.9 s.

**RULED: ask every manager the run will ask, at once.** Rule in **II.19**, reason in **V.122**.
A command that crawls the whole machine warms every listing before its first section runs
(`App::warm_installed`); a plan asks each manager it consults once, before it asks anything
about a package. **9.13 s â†’ 3.9 s, overlap 2.7Ã— â†’ 5.4Ã—, every listing starting inside a 0.26 s
window instead of spread over 5.4 s, and the report identical line for line.**

**What the ruling binds:**

- **Neither half adds a question.** The once-per-run memo already collapsed the duplicates, so
  what changed is *when*, not *how many*: same 33 children, same answers.
- **Only for commands that already ask everyone.** `warm_installed` is called by name at the two
  call sites that crawl the machine, never from `App::new`. A command that consults three
  managers must still wake three — pinned by a test that fails if a plan touches a manager
  nothing declares.
- **A concurrency budget spent on duplicate questions is spent on nothing.** `max_parallel` was
  never the limit here; twenty slots holding twenty futures that want one answer is a width of
  one, and no knob the user can turn says so.
- **Ordering, alongside.** The registry was a `HashMap`, so which managers got the first slots
  was Rust's per-process hash seed — two `shall list` runs differed by 530 lines and sorted the
  same. It is a `BTreeMap` now (**V.123**), which is also what makes any of these measurements
  reproducible.

**Left standing, and measured rather than assumed:** two managers still start late — `npm
prefix` and `pipx environment` at ~3.2 s — because their `info` needs a *second* question that
cannot be asked until their listing lands. That is a per-backend follow-up, not a wave, and it
is what the remaining ratio is made of.

**What could reverse it:** a machine where warming costs more than it saves — a manager whose
listing is expensive and whose section is usually skipped. None of the two call sites has one:
both end in a crawl of every manager.

## Y9

**Status: ANSWERED — built and ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as F-1, a speed finding. It is also an accuracy one, and that
half is new.

**Y9 — May Shall ask a manager what a package depends on, and act on the answer?** It did. The
planner ran `get_dependencies` on every declared spec, added each returned name to the desired
set as an install node of its own, and asked *those* nodes the same question. Seven backends
answered for real: `apt-cache depends`-shaped queries from brew, dnf, flatpak, pacman, snap,
vscode and xbps.

**RULED: no.** Shall installs what you declared. Rule in **II.7** and **II.19**, reason in
**V.115a**, gated by `tests/a_plan_installs_only_declarations_tests.rs`.

**Measured, both sides, in the Arch integration image with `pacman` behind a counting shim**
(`docker/integration/measure-batching.sh`). Six declared packages: **8 `pacman` invocations
â†’ 2**, of which **6 â†’ 0** were dependency queries; summed child time **3.70 s â†’ 1.20 s**; wall
clock **1.58 s â†’ 1.33 s**. The wall clock moves least because the six queries ran concurrently
— Rust's fan-out was hiding the waste rather than avoiding it. A sync is now two commands: ask
the manager what it has, install the difference in one line.

**What the change binds:**

- **An install node is a declaration or it does not exist.** `sync/mod.rs` writes one
  `state.add` per install node, so a discovered dependency became a package Shall *manages* —
  with `source: None`, an origin no user could be shown. II.7 says Shall removes
  what it manages and you stopped declaring, and nobody ever declared libfoo. They were shielded
  only by being re-derived identically each run, and `direct_dependencies` dropped a spec's
  entry on any error: **one failed `apt-cache depends` took the whole set out of the desired
  state at once**, and the next plan was a mass removal held back by `max_removals` alone.
- **`@requires` is unchanged and still splits the wave** (`Y1`). What the user wrote orders
  what the user wrote. Two co-declared packages that merely happen to be related now go on one
  command line — which `Y1` measured at 3,161 ms against 31,901 ms, and `rebuild --backend apt`
  maximises.
- **`MetadataProvider` stays, and reporting is the feature.** `shall info <name>` prints
  dependencies; `shall why` searches them for reverse dependencies. Neither plans from them.
- **The ledger row now has to say where it came from.** Confirming the ruling exposed that its
  own safety argument was unenforced: `sync/mod.rs` had two sites that stored whatever
  `__source` held, `None` included, where `verbs/plan.rs` supplied a fallback. Nothing reached
  them — `model/resolve.rs` stamps `__source` on every resolved line — so the invariant was true
  and unpinned, which is the shape the next hand-built spec walks through. `ManagedPackage::source`
  is a `String` and `StateRegistry::add` takes a `&str`; an unattributable row does not compile,
  and one already on disk is refused with the `adopt` instruction rather than dropped. Found with
  it, in the same family: `shall why`'s `hook` arm matched a bare `"hook"` where `declare.rs`
  writes `hook:<manager>`, so every hooked package got the fallback sentence.
- **One gate, not one per backend.** Every `ManagerConfig` in `registry.rs` had already
  reached this answer separately (`depends_args: None`, zypper's row carrying the finding as a
  comment, apt's
  carrying a test whose stated purpose was to stop the expansion being re-enabled). Every one of
  those was drawn around the backend under review; none reached the seven. The new gate is drawn
  around the property — nothing that plans reads a `MetadataProvider` — so it holds for the
  backend nobody has written yet. apt's per-backend test was deleted in the same commit.

**What the owner ruled, 2026-08-06.** Two things:

1. **A dependency is never an install. Confirmed.** A plan lists what you declared and nothing
   else.
2. **`@requires` keeps splitting the command line, and `Y1`'s clause stands unreversed.** The
   case for merging was that `apt install a b` orders a package dependency correctly by itself,
   so the split buys nothing. It buys the thing the user asked for. `@requires` is not Shall
   inferring a package relation — it is an ordering the user asserted, and it can mean what no
   manager knows: a daemon that must be up before the next package's postinstall runs, a binary
   the other one shells out to at configure time. A manager orders its own dependencies; it does
   not order somebody else's reasons. Merging the two would discard the only explicit ordering
   guarantee in the language to save one subprocess, in the one case where the user typed the
   edge on purpose. It fires nowhere else — unlike the native edges above, which appeared on
   their own.

**No migration, and none needed.** A machine carrying dependency rows from an earlier build
would read them as drift and plan them for removal — under `max_removals` (20) it would act,
which on a Debian box means `apt remove libssl3`. That hazard is real in shape and empty in
fact: Shall has no users, so the only machine that could hold such rows is the builder's, and
it does not. Its `registry.json` has 323 rows, 4 without a `source` — `cowsay` on pnpm, yarn,
pipx and bun at one timestamp, a hand-test of one name across four managers, not a dependency
closure. A load-time drop of origin-less rows was designed and **rejected as code guarding a
machine that does not exist**; the rows are wrong data, not an old format, and this is a
rewrite.

**What could reverse it:** a manager that installs a declared package and *not* its
dependencies. None of the 23 that answer a dependency query does; one that did would need its
dependencies declared, not discovered.

---

## Y10

**Status: ANSWERED — built and ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as F-0, the top finding on the accuracy axis. Accurate on the
gap; wrong about its shape in both directions, and the corrections are below.

**Y10 — What does the write-ahead log cover, and what does a `dotfiles:` tree get?** Two
questions, and they turned out to be one: *what happens to a mutation Shall cannot recompute?*

`JournalAction` had two variants, `Install` and `Remove`. All nine `apply/` modules contained
**zero** references to the journal, so every non-package mutation happened outside the log,
while `readme.md` said *"a write-ahead log records every mutation before it runs"*.

**RULED, part one: the log covers what cannot be recomputed, and nothing else.**

The review proposed one variant per phase. That is wrong, and its own steelman says why. A
`service:`, a `setting:`, a `firewall:` rule, a placed `link:` is a read-then-write converge
from a declaration: killed halfway, the next sync reads the machine, sees the line unmet and
finishes the job. **Recomputing from the declaration is a better recovery than replaying a
log**, because it also corrects drift the log never saw. Journalling those is durability
theatre, and they stay out. Two things are not that and are now logged: an `exec:` script and
an `@undo=` shell command. Nothing records how far either got, their authors never promised
they were safe to run twice, and there is no declared end state to converge towards.

**Recovery reports an interrupted script; it does not replay one.** A package is finished by
installing it again — reaching a state twice is reaching it once. A script that got half way
has no recorded progress, so re-running it repeats the half that already ran. What `heal` owes
it is the account nobody was given: which script, its content hash, and that the next sync will
run it again from the top. Then the entry is resolved as **failed** — not completed, because it
did not complete, and not left open, because an entry that can never be recovered but stays
`InProgress` keeps `needs_recovery` true for ever, which is `Q33`'s 208 seconds.

**One correction to the finding.** It named `apply/extras.rs`'s teardown as one of three
irreversible phases. It is not: `reconcile` computes drift from a ledger it only writes *after*
the loop, so a kill mid-teardown leaves the ledger naming the same drift and the next sync
retries it. Checked and cleared, not fixed.

**RULED, part two: a `dotfiles:` tree is the `link:` lines it stands for.** This is the larger
half and the review understated it. It described the gap as *"killed between the remove and the
write"*. The gap was wider: **a run that completed successfully destroyed the user's file too.**

`link:` has had the whole lifecycle since `T6` — back the target up to `<dest>.shall-backup`
before taking the path over, restore it when the line goes away. `dotfiles:` — which
`verbs/sync.rs` calls *"a pile of `link:` lines"* and applies in the same phase — had its own
placement loop that called `remove_file` and symlinked over the top. No backup. No ledger row.
Therefore no teardown, no restore, and no removal guard. Deleting a file from a tree left a
**dangling symlink** on the machine for ever, under a summary reading `already up to date`.

**Four documents said the ledger row existed** — `model/dotfiles.rs`, `core/extras_lock.rs`,
`spec/history.md`, and `spec/plan.md`'s 7n, marked **DONE 2026-07-24**, whose stated exit
condition is *"a file deleted from the tree has its link removed by the same `extras_lock`
teardown every other extra uses."* No code wrote one. The tree was applied by a private loop
that no document described, and the design everyone was reading was never built.

So the tree now expands into the `link:` lines it stands for — one place, `Dotfiles::links` —
and everything downstream is the machinery that already existed: the `link:` backend places
them (backup, content short-circuit, cross-drive fallback), the extras ledger keys one row per
placed file, and the shared teardown restores the original through the guard. **~40 lines added,
one placement loop deleted, four behaviours gained.**

**The one consequence a user will see, stated rather than shipped quietly.** The shared teardown
is guarded, so deleting a `dotfiles:` line with more than `max_removals` files (20 by default)
is now **refused by name**, pointing at `[guard] max_removals`, where before it silently orphaned
every one of them. That is the ceiling doing exactly what it is for — it is already what happens
to twenty-one `link:` lines, and `also_removing` counts a tree's files against the same budget as
the packages in the same plan. It is called out here because it is the one place this change
makes a previously-silent operation stop, and because reversing it means exempting trees from the
guard, which would be the second teardown all over again.

**A sibling found while building it.** `Dotfiles::plan` answered *"did Shall put this here?"*
with `is_symlink`. `link:` had already learned that is wrong — where the deploy falls back to a
copy, a file Shall placed itself is not a symlink — and the tree's copy of the question never
heard. Under `is_symlink` alone the next sync called Shall's own copy a destination Shall did
not create and refused to touch the tree. The ledger is the record of ownership and now answers
it, in union with the old test so no destination becomes a fresh `U23` refusal on upgrade.

Rule in **II.2** (the `link:`/T6 section) and **II.19**, reason in **V.139** and **V.140**. Gated by
`tests/dotfiles_tree_is_a_pile_of_links_tests.rs`, which runs `dotfiles:` and `link:` against
the same bytes and asserts they answer the same, and by
`tests/the_log_covers_what_cannot_be_recomputed_tests.rs`, whose first test has the script under
test **read the journal while it is running** — the only witness that can tell a write-ahead
record from a write-behind one.

**Found under this, raised as `Q48`, and ruled the same day it was explained.**
`LinkBackendCore::is_same_drive` compared `Component::Prefix`, and `canonicalize` returns a
`\\?\C:` verbatim prefix where the target carries a plain `C:` — so **every `link:` on Windows
took the cross-drive COPY fallback, including same-drive ones.** The check is gone rather than
repaired: see `Q48`.

---

## Q48

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised the same day while building `Y10`.

**Q48 — Should `link:` symlink on Windows, or is the copy fallback now the behaviour?**
`is_same_drive` (`backends/link.rs`) compared the `Component::Prefix` of `source.canonicalize()`
against the raw target. `canonicalize` returns `\\?\C:\...`, whose prefix is `VerbatimDisk('C')`;
the target's is `Disk('C')`. They never matched, so **every** `link:` on Windows logged
*"Cross-drive fallback to COPY"* and copied — same drive or not. The dotfiles tree inherited it.

**RULED: a `link:` links.** The drive check is deleted, not repaired, because the limitation it
guarded does not exist: a Windows symlink stores its destination as a string and resolves it on
open, so it spans volumes — that is the *hard* link's restriction, not the symlink's. Verified
before deleting, with a second drive letter from `subst` and an unelevated `symlink_file` from
`C:` to `X:`: created, resolved, read through. Repairing the comparison would have kept a
fallback guarding nothing and still copied for the case symlinks handle.

**The privilege is the only thing that varies, so it is the only thing branched on.**
`ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD` (1314) falls back to a copy; every other error propagates, so a real
failure is no longer laundered into a silent copy. The fallback warns by name — the privilege,
the remedy (Developer Mode or an elevated shell), and the consequence the user will actually
meet, that edits stop propagating until the next sync. The third option, ruling the copy *is*
the behaviour, was rejected: it would retire the one thing `link:` exists for on the one platform
where the cure is a checkbox.

**Why it was not shipped when found.** Turning copies into symlinks can fail a sync that works
today — behaviour a user would notice, rule 2 of *asking while building*. The ownership predicate
was fixed instead, which stopped a run backing up its own copy every sync under a summary reading
`already up to date`, and made the bug wasteful rather than latent. `V.141`, `why.md`.

---

## Q49

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-10.** Raised by the first CI run that ever executed.

**Q49 — `pip:` does not work on a PEP 668 distro. What should Shall do about it?** Ubuntu,
Debian, Alpine, openSUSE and Fedora ship an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker beside their Python,
which tells pip the interpreter belongs to the distro's package manager. pip then refuses every
install — `--user` included — and it is right to: two package managers writing one
site-packages is how a system python stops booting. What a user saw was pip's own wall of text,
addressed to somebody typing `pip install` rather than to somebody who wrote a line in a
manifest.

It surfaced as coverage: the ubuntu, alpine and openSUSE lifecycle ratchets each fell 7 â†’ 6,
because the images had moved and pip could no longer complete a real install â†’ list â†’ remove.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): the refusal names `pipx:`, and `@system=true` is the per-line
escape hatch.**

1. **The default stays a refusal**, because the marker is right. Shall adds its own sentence to
   pip's, naming the two things a *declaration* can do — neither of which pip's text mentions,
   since pip does not know it is being driven by one.
2. **`pipx:` is the answer pointed at.** Shall already drives it, it works on every one of those
   distros, and installing each application in its own environment is the thing it exists for.
3. **`@system=true` writes into the system Python anyway**, passing pip's
   `--break-system-packages`. Per line, never a global switch, and it splits the batch: one
   line's permission must never be handed to the packages beside it, which is the same rule
   `@unverified` follows and with a worse blast radius here.
4. **The flag is asked of the tool before it is sent.** `--break-system-packages` arrived in pip
   23.0.1; an older pip answers `no such option`, and emitting it blind would trade a refusal a
   user can act on for an argv defect they cannot.
5. **`@system` is legal on `pip` and refused by name everywhere else.** An option accepted where
   nothing reads it is an option that does nothing and says nothing.

The rule is in **II.49**; the reason is in **V.179**.

---

## Q50

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-10.** Raised by the first CI run that ever executed.

**Q50 — A killed run leaves the package manager's own lock behind, and every later run fails.
Should `heal` clear it?** The arch integration leg kills Shall mid-sync on purpose. pacman dies
with it, `/var/lib/pacman/db.lck` stays on disk, and from that point every command on that
machine fails:

```text
error: failed to init transaction (unable to lock database)
error: could not lock database: File exists
```

Shall's diagnosis is already good — it relays pacman's advice and adds *"tried 4 times; the
failure did not change, so this is not the transient failure its output looks like"*. It simply
could not act, and the same crash on a laptop leaves a user with a package manager that never
works again until they find that sentence and act on it themselves.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): `heal` clears a manager lock it can prove nothing holds.**

1. **`heal` only, never `sync`.** Deleting another package manager's file is a repair somebody
   asked for by name, not something a converge does on the way past.
2. **Only locks whose *existence* is the lock** — pacman's `db.lck`, dnf's
   `metadata_lock.pid`, zypper's `/run/zypp.pid`. **apt and dpkg are excluded and the exclusion
   is data**, not an omission: those files exist permanently and are locked with `flock(2)`, the
   kernel drops the lock when the holder dies, and deleting one deletes what the next `apt`
   expects to lock.
3. **Staleness is proved.** A lock carrying a pid is stale when that pid is not running; one
   carrying no pid is stale when no process of that manager is running at all. Not proved is not
   stale — a half-written pid file is left alone.
4. **Every removal is reported by name, with the reason.** A repair nobody sees is the silence
   P3 forbids, and this one deletes a file the user did not create.
5. **A removal Shall cannot perform is still reported**, because a lock it could not clear is
   one the user now knows about.

The rule is in **II.50**; the reason is in **V.180**.

---

## Q51

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-10.** Raised by the arch CI leg that `Q50` was meant to fix,
which failed again for a different reason.

**Q51 — Another package manager is holding its own lock. Should Shall wait for it, or fail?**
`Q50` taught `heal` to clear a lock nothing holds. This is the other half, and it is the common
one: the lock is held by a `pacman` or an `apt` that is *running*, in another terminal, or on an
unattended-upgrade timer, or — as CI found — orphaned by a killed Shall and still finishing the
transaction it was given.

Shall retried four times over about three and a half seconds and then said:

> tried 4 times; the failure did not change, so a further retry will not help — **this is not the
> transient failure its output looks like**

Every clause of that is wrong here. It *is* the transient failure it looks like; a further retry
is exactly what helps, once the holder is done. And Shall already knows how to do the right
thing — it waits politely on *its own* data-directory lock, announcing the holder, for two
minutes. It would not extend the same courtesy to the package manager's.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): it should not fail there at all. Wait for it.**

1. **The three states are three answers, and the machine is asked which one it is in.** The
   manager's message is the same either way; `/proc` is what knows. *Held by something live* â†’
   wait, announcing the holder. *On disk with nothing holding it* â†’ fail at once and name `shall
   heal`, because waiting on a corpse never ends. *Free* â†’ the holder let go mid-retry, which is
   an ordinary race and gets the ordinary backoff.
2. **Bounded, and the bound is one budget across the whole retry loop** — `manager_lock_wait_secs`,
   default 300. Sized for the *other* manager's transaction, not for Shall's patience: a `dnf
   upgrade` of a hundred packages legitimately runs that long. `0` opts out.
3. **The wait announces itself the moment it starts.** A wait with no reason given is
   indistinguishable from a hang, and a hang is what people kill — which is the interruption
   that leaves the wedged machine `Q50` is about.
4. **Nothing is scanned unless the manager already said the word.** The `/proc` question is
   asked only after a failure whose text matched that manager's own phrasing for a taken lock,
   so a successful install never pays for this and a missing package never waits on it.
5. **Backends that drive one manager take one lock.** `pacman` and `yay` in one config is an
   ordinary Arch machine and both write `/var/lib/pacman/`; keyed by their own names they were
   two locks over one database, and Shall contended with itself. Same for `apt`/`apt-get` and
   `dnf`/`yum`/`microdnf`.

The rule is in **II.51**; the reason is in **V.181**.

---

## Q52

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-10.** Raised while fixing `Q51`, by asking what created the
orphaned `pacman` in the first place.

**Q52 — What does Shall own, of the processes it starts?** Two failures, in opposite directions,
from the same missing idea.

*It killed what it should have asked.* `kill_on_drop(true)` and `start_kill()` are **SIGKILL**,
which cannot be caught — so a package manager Shall stopped on a timeout got no chance to roll
its transaction back or unlink its lock. Shall was manufacturing the wedged machine `Q50` exists
to unwedge. Worse: Shall's child is usually `sudo`, and SIGKILL kills `sudo` alone, leaving the
real manager running as root with its parent gone — which is precisely the orphan `Q51` had to
be taught to wait for.

*It abandoned what it should have owned.* Awaiting `Command::output()` and dropping that future
does not kill the process; tokio detaches it. Seventeen sites did that, including a secret
decrypt whose own timeout freed the sync and left `gpg` running **under a comment promising it
would not**, and the `generate:` commands that run on every single sync with no bound at all.
Ten of the seventeen were found by the gate, not by reading.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): every process Shall starts belongs to Shall, and there are three
doors.**

1. **A child is asked to stop before it is killed** — SIGTERM, a grace period, then SIGKILL only
   for one that will not go. `sudo` forwards a SIGTERM; nothing forwards a SIGKILL.
2. **Captured, bounded, owned** (`supervised_output`) for a tool nobody is watching.
   **Terminal handed over, unbounded, still owned** (`supervised_status`) for a program a person
   is looking at — an editor at a prompt is not a hung command, but it must not outlive Shall.
3. **A blocking `std::process::Command` goes through the third door** (`blocking::command_output`).
   Its hazard is the opposite one: it cannot be abandoned, so it holds a runtime worker until the
   child exits. So do the human-facing waits — a confirm, a TUI — and the data-directory lock,
   which slept a worker for up to two minutes.
4. **A gate, not a sweep.** `tests/a_spawned_child_has_an_owner_tests.rs` fails on a new
   `Command` that reaches `spawn`/`output`/`status` outside the executor, unless it is in an
   exemption table with a sentence. Fixing seventeen sites fixes seventeen sites; this is what
   stops the eighteenth.

The rule is in **II.52**; the reason is in **V.182**.

---

## Z1

**Status: ANSWERED** (owner, 2026-08-09). Raised by the readiness audit, 2026-08-03 (`AU12`).
When raised it was not blocking, because nothing in the tree read it. Blocking for *distribution*, which is a different question and the one that
matters — `scripts/install.sh` and `shall self-upgrade` both hand this program to other people.

**Z1 — Under what licence is Shall published?** There is no `LICENSE` file at the repo root and
no `license` key in `Cargo.toml`. Under the Berne Convention that is not "free to use" — it is
*all rights reserved by default*, so a user who runs the install script has no licence to the
copy they now hold, and `crates.io` will refuse the package outright.

**This is the owner's to answer and nobody else's.** It is a legal choice about someone else's
work, it cannot be inferred from the code, and picking one silently would be the worst possible
version of "the builder made the call": every later contribution inherits it and un-picking it
needs every contributor's agreement.

**What an answer has to say:** the licence, and whether `Cargo.toml` gains `license = "..."`
(needed for a crates.io release) or `license-file`. The two conventional answers for a Rust CLI
are `MIT OR Apache-2.0` (the Rust ecosystem default, permissive) and `GPL-3.0-or-later` (the
package-manager tradition — dpkg, dnf, pacman). No recommendation is offered here, because a
recommendation on this one is a decision wearing a suggestion's clothes.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-09): `MIT OR Apache-2.0`.**

The Rust ecosystem's default pair, and the reason it is a pair rather than a preference: MIT is
the shortest permissive licence anyone will actually read, and Apache-2.0 carries the explicit
patent grant a company's lawyer looks for. A user takes whichever they can accept. The other
answer on the table — `GPL-3.0-or-later`, the package-manager tradition — was not chosen; Shall
is a tool people run rather than a library they link, and the copyleft it buys costs the
easy-adoption story the install script exists for.

**Shipped with the ruling:**

- `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` at the repo root, both stamped `2026 Shall Contributors`.
- `license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"` in `Cargo.toml`, and `publish = false` **deleted** — it was
  there only because crates.io refuses a package with no `license` key, which was a statement of
  today's truth rather than a preference, and today's truth changed.
- `deny.toml`'s `private = { ignore = true }` **deleted**. It existed so that gate would not
  answer this question by implication; both halves of the expression are already in its `allow`
  list, so Shall's own crate now answers the same licence gate every dependency does.
- A `## Licence` section in `readme.md`, saying which file is which and that contributions come
  in under the same terms.

## Z2

**Status: ANSWERED** (owner, 2026-08-03). Raised by the readiness audit the same day (`AU8`).
Built in the same change.

**Z2 — `lock` and `unlock` were not inverses, and the mis-pairing could move packages.**

| command | what it touched |
|---|---|
| `lock` | `locks/versions.json`, and approved hooks and adapters at their current hash |
| `unlock` | `locks/bare.HOST.toml` — which *manager* an unpinned bare name resolved to |

Different files, unrelated jobs. Someone who ran `shall lock`, changed their mind and typed
`shall unlock` did not undo the pin: they discarded the recorded backend resolution, and
`unlock`'s own help stated the consequence — *"sync uninstalls the cargo copy, because two of
the same package is what this avoids."* So the obvious undo for a harmless command could
uninstall software.

**Reading the code to answer it found the surface was wider than the report.** There were not two
things called "the lock" but *three* — version pins, backend resolutions, and the approval hashes
for everything the config can execute — plus `hold`/`unhold`, which is a different question
(exemption from `upgrade`, not a freeze) and stays where it is. Only one of the three had an
inverse at all: **version pins could not be released by any command**, only by hand-editing
`locks/versions.json`. `sync --upgrade` is a per-run bypass, not an undo.

**And a second defect, in the same family.** `locks/versions.json` is written by exactly two
things — `lock`, and `heal`. Not by `sync`, not by `upgrade`. So `shall upgrade` moved a package
from 7.81.0 to 8.0.1, the pin still said 7.81.0, and the next ordinary `sync` — which converges
to the lock (U11) — read the old version back as `@version=`, found the installed one did not
satisfy it (an unadorned version is an equality constraint), and planned the package straight
back down. The upgrade did not stick. `sync --upgrade` had the same hole.

### The ruling

**Both verbs name the axis they act on**, as a positional value with `all` as the default:

```
shall lock   [versions|backends|scripts|all] [NAME…] [--list]
shall unlock [versions|backends|scripts|all] [NAME…] [--list]
```

- `versions` — the pins in `locks/versions.json`. `lock versions` records what is installed;
  `unlock versions` drops the pins, which nothing could do before.
- `backends` — `locks/bare.HOST.toml`. `unlock backends` is the old `unlock`, unchanged in
  behaviour and now unmistakable in name. `lock backends` records the resolutions explicitly,
  which previously only happened as a side effect of a sync.
- `scripts` — `locks/hooks.toml`: hooks, event hooks, adapters, `exec:`, `generate:`,
  health-check commands and the `vars` provider. `lock scripts` is the old approval half of
  `lock`; `unlock scripts` withdraws approval, which nothing could do before.
- **A bare `lock` or `unlock` means `all`** (owner ruling): a bare `lock` does what `lock` always
  did, plus recording backend resolutions, and a bare `unlock` releases all three. It is not
  gated behind a confirmation — the axis is what a user types to be careful, and a prompt on a
  command whose whole job is this would be the asking that II.15 already rejects.
- `NAME` scopes any axis and matches the whole ledger key or its tail: `unlock versions curl` and
  `unlock versions apt:curl` both pick out `apt:curl`.
- A name that picks nothing out **warns and changes nothing**, naming the ledger. It is not an
  error, matching what `unlock` already did for an unfrozen name.

**And every path that deliberately moves a version forward re-records it** — `upgrade` in all its
modes, and `sync --upgrade`. **Only entries already in the lock are refreshed.** A package nobody
pinned has no stale record to fight, and pinning it would make every `upgrade` a silent `lock`.

**What was rejected.** Renaming `unlock` to `forget-backend` and leaving `lock` without an
inverse was the recommendation this entry carried, and the owner went the other way: the axis
belongs in the grammar rather than in a verb name, because there were three ledgers rather than
two and a per-ledger verb name would have needed six. `NO LEGACY` applies — there is no `unlock`
that takes a bare name any more, and a name where the axis goes is refused with the three axes
listed rather than guessed at.

## Q25

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised in `docs/archive/DIRECTIONS-2026-08-03.md` as `Q-A`/`Q-B`/`Q-F`
before that file was rewritten; the letters are recorded here so the old references resolve.

**Q25 — May ownership be derived from the config repo's git history?** `registry.json` records
what Shall owns, and it is the only one of the three sources of truth nothing else can
reconstruct: the config says what you want, the machine says what is there, and the ledger says
what Shall put there. Six subsystems exist to serve it — `core/state.rs`, `core/datalock.rs`,
`app/bundle.rs`, `app/snapshot_restore.rs`, `main.rs`'s `READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`, and much of
`app/adopt.rs`. The proposal was to derive ownership from II.1's git history instead and demote
the ledger to a deletable cache.

**RULED: no, in both forms.**

**The strong form makes git required for `sync`, not for `history`.** Git is optional today and
that is deliberate: `core/git.rs` is a dependency-free shell-out (no `git2`, no `gix`, no
libgit2 build cost), and its own refusal says *"install it to use Shall's manifest history —
`shall git`, `diff`, `rollback` and `bundle`. Everything else works without it."* X.5 gives a
git-less machine `bundle` in place of history. Deriving ownership from history inverts that: the
verb that touches the machine hardest becomes the one that stops working, and git is absent by
default on Windows, in a minimal container, and on a small server. *Install git before you can
uninstall a package* is not a sentence this tool gets to say.

**The weak form was designed out and then measured, which is what killed it.** Git as a
corroborating second source: intersection governs removal, union governs reporting, three-valued
so a machine that cannot answer abstains rather than voting "foreign". It is a coherent design.
It also **misses AU4** — the most recent real instance of the failure it exists to catch — because
a fresh config sandbox with a stale data dir has no history to be authoritative with, so git
abstains on all seven phantom removals. It misses the over-broad `adopt` case that `adopt.rs`'s
own header warns about, because adopt writes its lines into the manifest and commits them, so git
agrees with the wrong ledger. What remains is "a registry from another machine or another time" —
real, but narrow, against a four-condition abstention gate, a history walk on the removal path,
and a reconcile mode. **`guard.rs` is already the general brake on a plan that removes too much,
and it does not care why the registry is wrong.**

**What survives.** Git as *enrichment* where it happens to be present — the commit, the date, the
message you wrote, in `shall why`. Nothing votes on ownership, nothing needs reconciling, and its
absence costs a clause rather than a verb. That is the surviving half and it is tracked in
`docs/archive/DIRECTIONS-2026-08-03.md` §4.

`registry.json` remains the source of truth for ownership. No rule in Part II changes.

---

## Q26

**Status: DEFERRED — 2026-08-03.**

**Q26 — Is the plan a public versioned artifact?** Twenty-two backends have ever run against a
real package manager; **thirty never have.** But most of what a backend is comes down to "given
`pipx:black`, what argv do you run" — a string, checkable with the manager absent. `plan` already
computes those strings, which is why plan-smoking covers 45 backends while execution covers 22.

**Two halves, ruled apart.**

**The internal object: build it.** A stable, serializable plan the code passes around, with argv
assertions per backend against it — all 52, any machine, milliseconds, nothing installed. This is
coverage for the thirty backends that will never get a container image, and it is the only
verification strategy in sight that scales faster than one image at a time. It changes no
user-visible behaviour and needs no further ruling.

**The public schema: deferred.** A published format with a hard refusal on mismatch is a
permanent compatibility surface under NO-LEGACY — there is no dual-reader when it changes. It
buys fleet deployment (compute here, apply there) and plan-diffs in code review, and neither has
been asked for. Deferred rather than refused: the internal object is its precondition, so nothing
is foreclosed by waiting.

**Constraint this places on everything else:** `model::Resolver` must stay pure. It is the only
component testable without a machine, and the argv assertions rest entirely on that. Merging it
with `app::sync::StateResolver` — which the name similarity invites — would put I/O inside it and
destroy this.

---

## Q27

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.** Raised as `Q-E`.

**Q27 — Does Part II gain a tier-1 / tier-2 distinction?** The proposal was to state in Part II
that some declarations are ones Shall owns end to end and can undo exactly — `link:`,
`dotfiles:`, `setting:`, `@bin` artifacts, `exec:` with `@undo=` — while every package backend,
`service:`, `firewall:` and `repo:` delegate to a manager that mutates global state in place; and
to print which tier each row is in during `plan`, since "this can be undone exactly" and "this is
guarded and snapshotted but undoing it is a restore" are different promises printed identically
today.

**RULED: no.** The owner declined it.

Recorded rather than dropped, because the observation that produced it recurs: `setting:` already
does read-before-write per II.2, which is tier-1 behaviour arrived at locally for one statement
without any general rule being stated. An auditor who notices that will re-propose this. It has
been asked and answered.

---

## Q28

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-03.**

**Q28 — Is a command that reports success over a false picture of the machine a defect class?**
There are two ways this tool can be wrong: it can do the wrong thing, or it can do the right
thing and tell you something false about it. **The second is worse** — after the first you can go
and look at your machine, and after the second you stop looking, because you were told it was
fine.

Two instances, one session, neither a crash and both exit 0:

| command | Shall said | what was true |
|---|---|---|
| `shall check` | `ok  drift  the machine matches your files` | **false** (AU1) |
| `shall --config-dir X init` | `created`, `kept` | true about *what*, wrong about *where* |

**RULED: yes.** The rule is in **II.20**; the reason is in **V.128**.

The three sub-rules: *"nothing to do" is a claim about the world and has to be earned*; *every
mutation states where, not just what*; *absence is reported like presence*. `Declined::reported`
(`app/sync/planner.rs`) is the first of them already built for one path — its own comment says
the type exists so that *"does the user hear about this?" cannot be answered by omission*, and an
empty plan with a non-empty `skipped` is not `already up to date`. The rule generalises what that
type does for removals to every path that reports.

This is the standard the error messages already meet — file, line, what is wrong, what to do, and
what the concept means — applied to success, to absence, and to history rather than only to
failure.

---

## Q29

**Status: HALF RULED, 2026-08-04.** The resource-kind half is ruled **no — the set stays open**:
*"i dont think it is closed, no. we still might add."* The computation half is **still open** and
is not implied by it; nobody has ruled on whether a fourth `vars` provider or another logic
keyword may be added, and this register does not answer a question the owner did not answer.

**What the ruling means in code.** Nothing is frozen and nothing is banned. `KEYWORDS` may grow a
twelfth prefix. What the ruling *costs* is documentation drift, and that bill is now paid by
`tests/grammar_table_matches_the_spec_tests.rs`: Part II's Statements table and its reserved-word
block are both asserted against `KEYWORDS`, in both directions, grouped by `KeywordRole`. Adding
a prefix without documenting it fails the build.

**The ruling was expensive to defer by exactly one prefix.** `generate:` shipped as U33, sits in
`KEYWORDS`, has its own rule in Part II — and was missing from Part II's Statements table until
2026-08-04, *directly beneath the paragraph warning that three earlier prefixes had gone missing
the same way*. Four, not three. Prose does not fail a build.

**Q29 — Is the statement set closed?** `config/grammar/statement.rs` is 3,406 lines, the largest
file in `src/`, and it has grown `when`, `param`, `vars` with three providers, `generate:`,
`exec:` and user verbs. The proposal was to declare the config language **data**, freeze the
keyword list, and route all future computation through `generate:` — a command whose stdout is
declarations, written in a real language.

**The question as posed has a hole in it.** `generate:` output is merged *"as if typed"*, so it
re-enters this same grammar: a generator can emit a thousand computed `apt:` lines and **cannot
emit a statement kind that does not exist**. Generators expand *quantity*, not *kind*. It is also
off by default behind `allow_generators` and runs through the II.12 ledger, which makes it a
sound escape hatch and a weak policy for absorbing the future.

**So it splits, and the halves want different answers:**

- **Is computation closed** — no more logic keywords, no fourth `vars` provider, no `repl`?
  `generate:` genuinely covers this. *Recommended: yes.*
- **Is the resource-kind set closed** — never another `foo:` prefix? Nothing absorbs the twelfth
  kind if that is wrong, and extensibility grades Aâˆ’ precisely because the backend mechanism is
  open. *Recommended: no.*

**Either way, the motivation has a better cure than a ban.** Part II has three times failed to
list a statement it shipped — `exec:`, `dotfiles:` and `firewall:` — and Q16 later had to refuse
nine more bare keywords that fell through the same hole. `KEYWORDS` in `statement.rs` is already
the single list (its comment records that three copies had drifted until
`setting:HKCU\Software\Foo` was read as a set difference by the only one that had never heard of
`setting:`). **A test asserting `KEYWORDS` matches Part II's statement table** makes the twelfth
keyword impossible to ship undocumented, without closing anything. That is an afternoon and it is
sequenced ahead of this ruling in `docs/archive/DIRECTIONS-2026-08-03.md` §6.

## Q30

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-04.** Filed inside `Q29`'s entry for its first three months,
with no heading of its own — so the register could not count it, `decision-count.sh` never saw
it, and the status it inherited by position was `Q29`'s **HALF RULED** rather than its own. It
had an index row the whole time, and `registry/mod.rs`, `backend_is_data_not_code_tests.rs` and
`terminator_probe_tests.rs` all cite `Q30` by name. **A decision the code names and the register
cannot count is the drift this file exists to end**, so it is promoted here rather than left
where it was written (`J9`'s round).

**Q30 — Is the `--` terminator a property of a label, and is the table keyed on the wrong thing?**
**RULED 2026-08-04: read the terminator off the tokens; keep one key per binary.**

Two questions, one measured answer each.

**The label.** `VersionPin` had three variants whose `apply` bodies were character-for-character
identical — `Flag`, `TrailingPositional`, `RequiredFlag`. They built the same argv; only the
variant *name* decided whether `push_names` was allowed to emit `--`, because a version spelled
`-v 1.6` is an option and one spelled `1.6` is an operand. Three backends carry a bare operand
version and were spread across two of the labels:

| backend | pin args | labelled | terminator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gem` | `["-v", "{version}"]` | `Flag` | dropped — correct, `-v` is an option |
| `pub` | `["{version}"]` | `TrailingPositional` | kept — correct |
| `luarocks` | `["{version}"]` | `Flag` | **dropped — wrong** |
| `mix` | `["{version}"]` | `Flag` | **dropped — wrong** |
| `asdf` | `["{version}"]` | `RequiredFlag` | dropped — right answer, wrong reason |

So `luarocks install -- jq` carried the terminator and `luarocks install jq 1.6` did not: same
tool, same command, protection that came and went with whether the line named a version.

**The ruling is that nobody labels it.** An option starts with `-`; that is what "option" means
to every argument parser ever written. The three variants collapse to one `After { args,
unpinned }`, `Before` is the old `LeadingFlag`, and `emits_trailing_option()` looks at the first
token. Exactly two argvs in the tree change — `luarocks` and `mix` gain their `--` on pinned
installs — and both were measured before the change, not after.

Measured in the `tools` image, 2026-08-04:

```text
$ luarocks install --                       Error: missing argument 'rock'
                                            usage: luarocks install [...] <rock> [<version>]
$ luarocks install -- <rock> <version>      identical to the same line without `--`
$ mix archive.install hex --force -- <name> identical, both naming the operand
$ dart pub global activate -- <pkg> <ver>   identical; usage `activate <package> [version-…]`
```

`asdf` keeps its answer and loses its excuse: its `latest` fallback is an operand too, so the
pin no longer claims a trailing option — and `asdf` still gets no `--`, from the binary table,
which is the layer that measured it (`No such plugin: --`). Two layers, each honest, agreeing by
accident no longer.

**The key.** The proposal was to key the terminator table on `(binary, verb)` rather than on
`binary`, on the theory that `gem`'s `--` breaks `install` but would be safe on `list` — which
would give `gem` and `nimble` back the terminator on the paths that do not break. **Rejected: the
theory is false.** Measured, same image, same day:

```text
$ gem list -- <bogus>        lists EVERY gem — the filter is swallowed, a wrong answer not an error
$ gem uninstall -- <bogus>   Please specify at least one gem name
$ nimble -y uninstall -- x   Error: Unknown option: --
$ nimble -y list -- x        Error: Unknown option: --
$ spack find -- <bogus>      No package matches the query: -- <bogus>
$ spack uninstall -y -- x    ~~<bogus> does not match any installed packages
$ asdf list -- <bogus>       No such plugin: --
```

All four blanket bans are correct on every verb tested, and `gem list` is the worst case in the
set — it does not fail, it answers wrongly. A per-verb dimension would have shipped with zero
true entries and one more table to keep honest. The premise was a guess; the guess was wrong.

**What ships with the ruling.** One terminator table instead of two (the second was
`#[cfg(test)]`, so half the production facts compiled only into tests), every row carrying the
tool's own sentence or an admission that nobody asked, a ratchet on the admissions, and
`tests/terminator_probe_tests.rs` — a differential probe that runs each manager's real argv with
and without the terminator and compares exit code, operand echo and the presence of a bare `--`.
It reads its argvs from the registry rather than a list, and CI points it at the `tools` image,
where thirty managers live instead of a runner's eight. That gap is why `luarocks`, `mix` and
`asdf` went unasked: not a missing gate, a gate never pointed at a machine that could answer.

---

## Q31

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: recommendation (1) plus (2). Two meanings, two words, and the verb is named after
what it deletes.** `unmanaged` keeps E6's meaning — what `adopt` would take. The wider set,
every installed package nothing declares, is **`undeclared`**, and it is the word on `check
drift`, in the readme, in the JSON key, and in the command name: **`purge-unmanaged` is now
`purge-undeclared`.** There is no alias for the old verb name — a compatibility spelling is
exactly the second implementation this repo keeps deleting, and a user typing the old name gets
clap's unknown-subcommand error rather than the delete they misread.

`installed_but_unmanaged()` follows the word to `installed_but_undeclared()`, as does the
`SnapshotLabel` (never parsed back, only written), the `GuardScope`, and the
`never_unattended` default list in `[guard]`.

**Ruled in the same sitting: `Q47`, which shrinks this problem without solving it.** With
OS-essential packages adopted as live lines, most of the 34 become declared and the two numbers
converge on this machine. They do not converge in general — a backend that cannot attribute an
install to a choice still answers the two questions differently — so the rename stands on its
own and is not made redundant by `Q47`.

Rule in II.11; why in V.138. Below is why it was raised.

**One word, two numbers, and the command is named after the losing one.** On the same machine in
the same minute:

```
shall check           ->  ok  unmanaged   everything you chose is managed
shall check drift     ->  ? unmanaged — installed but not in your manifests (34):
shall check unmanaged ->  1 package(s) `shall adopt` would take
                          33 package(s) the OS reports as essential are left alone
```

Neither number is wrong. They answer different questions and **both questions have a command
that acts on them**:

- **what `adopt` would take** — `adopter().discover().adopt`. This is what `check unmanaged` and
  the `check` rollup report, and `verbs/check.rs:3` records that it was *chosen* for the word:
  the section used to answer the other question, `unmanaged` and `adopt` disagreed by a factor of
  four, and E6 asked for this one.
- **everything installed that nothing declares** — `installed_but_unmanaged()`. This is what
  `check drift` lists, what `readme.md:670` defines the word as, and — the awkward part — what
  **`purge-unmanaged` deletes**.

So the register chose one meaning for the word and the most destructive command in the program is
named after the other. The fix that was applied for E6 reached one of the three surfaces; this is
the same class the grade calls *"the correct behaviour already exists at a different site"*, one
layer up, in the vocabulary rather than the code.

**Why it is not the builder's.** Every way out renames something a user reads or types:

1. **`check drift` stops using the word.** Cheapest. `? installed and not declared —
   `purge-unmanaged` would remove (34)`, and `readme.md:670` moves with it. But `purge-unmanaged`
   then names a set the word `unmanaged` no longer describes anywhere.
2. **`purge-unmanaged` is renamed** to whatever the second meaning is called. Honest, and it is a
   published verb name that scripts run.
3. **`check unmanaged` gives the word back** and becomes `check adoptable`. Reverses E6's choice,
   which was made on a measurement.

**Recommendation: (1) plus (2)** — pick one word for "installed and nothing declares it", use it
on `check drift`, in the readme, and in the command name, and leave `unmanaged` meaning what E6
ruled it means. Two meanings need two words; which two is the owner's call, because all three
routes change what a user reads and one changes what they type.

## Q32

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: the bound covers the read.** The same silence clock keeps running over the output
readers once the child has exited — same `command_idle_timeout_secs`, same `Permanent` class, no
new dial — and a pipe that has produced nothing for the bound and still has not closed gets its
readers aborted and the command **fails by name**. That second half is the ruling that matters:
before it the command exited 0 and the install was reported a success.

Silence and not duration, so a command still printing is never cut off; the bound is not reached
by a slow command, only by a quiet one. Killing the orphan itself — a Windows Job Object, a
process group on Unix — is still **not** done here: it is platform-specific, it changes what
"kill" means, and it is a separate decision rather than a rider on this one.

`a_detached_grandchild_cannot_hold_the_read_open_past_the_bound` is no longer `#[ignore]`d and
now also asserts the failure, its wording and its retryability. Below is why it was raised.

**Q24's bound watches the wrong half of the wait.** `RawExecutor::wait_watched` bounds
`child.wait()` — the child's *exit*. The read of its output is outside that bound:

```rust
let status = match idle { ... };     // bounded; kills on silence
...
stdout: joined(out_task.await)?,     // no clock of any kind
stderr: joined(err_task.await)?,
```

`out_task.abort()` exists, but only inside the timeout branch, which is unreachable once
`child.wait()` has returned. So when a manager hands its stdout to a background process and
exits, the direct child is gone, a grandchild still holds the write end, and Shall reads
toward an EOF that never arrives. Nothing bounds it: not `command_idle_timeout_secs`, not the
DAG timeout, not `kill_on_drop` — there is no child left to kill.

**Measured, twice.** In a real sweep, `shall -y install nimble:nimjson` sat at **zero CPU with
no children at all** while three orphaned `nim.exe`/`nimble.exe` ran at `PPID 0`, outside
Shall's process tree. Then reproduced deterministically with a fake manager that detaches:
`command_idle_timeout_secs = 20`, a child holding stdout for 60s, **64s wall** — and

**it exited 0 and reported the install a SUCCESS**, timing the task at 60771ms.

That second half is a separable defect and arguably the worse one: Q28 rules that a command
reporting success while leaving a false picture is a defect class of its own.

**Recommendation** — keep the same clock running over the readers once the child has exited:
silence, not duration, the same 900, the same message, the same `Permanent` class, no new dial.
A pipe that has produced nothing for the bound and still has not closed gets its readers
aborted and the command fails **by name**. A bound a command can walk around is not a bound.

**Not recommended now, and named so it is not silently skipped:** killing descendants with the
child (a Windows Job Object, a process group on Unix). It is the deeper fix, it is
platform-specific, and it changes what "kill" means — a separate decision, not a rider on this

## Q33

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: recovery finishes interrupted work, and nothing else.** `heal` acts on `InProgress` and
`Abandoned`. A `Failed` entry reached an outcome and reported it; the package is not installed
and its line is still in the manifest, so the very next `sync` schedules it again — retrying it
in recovery was the same work twice, not extra coverage. The trigger and the work are now one
predicate, which is what stopped one unrecoverable interrupted entry from running a full
recovery of every past failure in front of every sync. `Failed` becomes terminal and ages out
like `Completed`; `InProgress` is still never purged at any age.

**And: recovery runs on the transaction engine.** The `for` loop with `install(from_ref(spec))`
in it is deleted. Recovery builds a graph — dependency edges from the journal's own specs — and
hands it to `Transaction`, which batches per manager and runs the waves in parallel. Two
settings differ from a sync's and both follow from what recovery is: no rollback, and
`continue_on_error`, so one entry nobody can finish does not leave the others unfinished. A node
whose dependency failed is reported as skipped, naming the one that stopped it. Full reasoning
in V.135.

**Already shipped before the ruling, and kept:** 22 journal entries naming one operation are one
recovery, not 22 — they are one operation attempted 22 times. Below is the original entry.

**Ruled: 22 journal entries naming one operation are one recovery, not 22.** They are not 22
operations — they are one operation attempted 22 times, because `record_start` mints a fresh id
per attempt. `heal` now collapses its unresolved entries by *what a recovery would do* (backend,
name, and install-or-remove), acts once, and resolves every entry that named the same thing,
because a single attempt decides all of them. Two interrupted installs of one spec are one
reinstall; an interrupted install and an interrupted removal of the same package are not, and
stay two.

That takes 23 real `scoop install` round trips for one name down to one. It does **not** answer
the question below, and deliberately: `heal` still acts on `Failed`.

**Still open:** is a failed attempt interrupted work? Below is the case for saying it is not.

**`heal` reinstalls things that are not interrupted, once per attempt ever made.**
`Journal::get_incomplete_actions()` returns `InProgress | Failed | Abandoned`, and every failed
install writes a **new** operation rather than resolving the old one. Counted in one sweep's
journal: **22 separate operations for a single `scoop:shall-no-such-pkg-zzz`**, all of which
`heal` then reinstalls, each a real `scoop install` round trip.

Two things are wrong and they compound. A declaration that fails on every sync grows the
journal without bound, and `heal`'s cost grows with it — a machine that has failed one install
a hundred times has a `heal` that makes a hundred doomed calls.

**Recommendation** — `heal` acts on **interrupted** work (`InProgress`, `Abandoned`). A
`Failed` entry is not interrupted: it is a completed attempt with a known outcome, and its
recovery is what the failure message already told the user to do. Separately, an attempt at a
spec that already has an unresolved entry should resolve that entry rather than add a
twenty-third.

**Not asserted:** that including `Failed` was a mistake. `journal.rs:285` says `InProgress` and
`Failed` are never purged until resolved, so keeping them is deliberate; whether `heal` should
*act* on them is the open half.

## Q34

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: no change to the model; change what the failure says.** `install X` still converges the
whole configuration — that is what declarative means, and converging only X would let your files
and your machine disagree with no command noticing. What changes is the reporting:

- a failure now names **the declaration it happened for, and its file and line** — appended to
  the message and to nothing else, because `retry` and `absent_name` are what decide whether a
  line is withdrawn and a wrapper that loses them turns a withdrawable line into a wedge;
- `install` says outright when what failed is not what you asked for;
- and it no longer advises taking back the line you just wrote. `WhyKept::NameAbsentElsewhere` —
  the branch whose own name says the missing package belongs to a *different* declaration — was
  telling users to `shall unmanage` the one line that was fine. Found while building the check
  above. The withdrawal logic itself was already careful and says why; the advice beside it was
  not.

Full reasoning in V.136. Below is the original entry.

**One unresolvable declaration fails every later install of anything.** `shall -y install
bun:sort-package-json` planned this:

```
Planned changes:
  install 2   remove 0   (total 2 change(s))
  backends: bun, scoop        <- scoop = an unrelated leftover from an earlier section
```

The scoop member cannot resolve, the transaction fails, and the caller is told that
`bun:sort-package-json` failed. In one sweep this produced **seven** false defect verdicts —
bun, dotnet, github, nimble, pnpm, pub, winget — none of which had anything wrong with them.

This is not obviously a bug: Shall is declarative, `install` adds a line and converges, and
converging everything is the model working as designed. But the consequence is that **a single
bad line blocks every future install until someone unmanages it by hand**, and the error names
the innocent package.

**Recommendation** — no change to the model; change what the failure says and what it blocks.
A member that fails for a reason unrelated to the requested spec should not make the requested
spec's install report failure, and the message must name the declaration that actually failed.
The alternative — `install X` converges only X — is a much larger ruling and is not
recommended.

**Most of this is a symptom of a bug, not of the model.** The leftover is only in the manifest
because `scoop`'s failure was classified `unknown`, and it was classified `unknown` because
`register_scoop`, `register_winget` and `register_choco` never call `with_manager_policy` — the
three main Windows backends run with `ExitPolicy::default()`. Q1 (2026-07-27) already rules that
a permanent failure withdraws the line, so that half needs no ruling and is a straight fix; see
`docs/archive/FINDINGS-2026-08-05.md` §1a. What is left for this entry is only the message naming the
innocent package.

## Q35

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: U40's reason does not reach Windows, so neither does its rule.** `RawExecutor::mutator`
gives a Windows mutation `ChildStdin::Closed`; Unix keeps U40 exactly as written, because that is
where `sudo` is inserted and where the password prompt it exists for can happen. The visible
change is that a Windows manager which asks a question now fails fast with its own prompt
captured, instead of going silent for the whole bound and failing anyway.

Below is why it was raised — including that it was proposed as the cause of a stall and refuted
by measurement, which is why it stayed in this register instead of being fixed as a diagnosis.

**U40's reason does not reach Windows, but its rule does.** U40 (RULED 2026-07-27) says stdin
is the one stream a child may share and only a mutation may share it, because *"`sudo` asks for
a password on the terminal it was started from"*. On Windows `sudo` is never inserted —
`executor.rs:834` reads `if sudo && !cfg!(windows) && !Self::is_root()` — so no Windows
mutation has anything to ask, while the sharing stays and costs the full
`command_idle_timeout_secs` whenever a manager asks something else.

**Measured on this host** with a fake manager that reads stdin, same install both times:

| Shall's stdin | result |
|---|---|
| not a terminal | **48ms** — child gets `Stdio::null`, reads EOF, done |
| a real console | **21.9s** — the whole bound elapsing, at the shipped 900 a 15-minute silence |

**This was a wrong theory of the observed stall and is recorded anyway.** It was proposed as
the cause, and the capture refuted it — the wedged process had no child at all (Q32 is the
cause). It is kept because the hazard is real and measured, and because the next person to see
an idle `shall` should find both shapes here rather than rediscover this one.

**Recommendation** — on Windows the mutating layer uses `ChildStdin::Closed`. Unix keeps U40
exactly as ruled. The visible change is that a Windows manager which asks a question fails
fast with its own prompt captured, instead of going silent for fifteen minutes and failing
anyway.

## Q36

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: adoption declares only what the manager can put back.** `adopt` drives winget from
`winget export` — the manager's own restorable set — instead of `winget list`. On the measured
host that is **78 declarations instead of 280 rows**, and the 186 that are gone are the ones
`winget install` refuses. Where entries are dropped, adoption says how many, why, and names
some. The seam is `ManualListing::ExportFile`, not a winget branch, because the rule is about
managers whose listing outruns what they can reinstall — the rule is in `target-state.md`
(II.10, adoption table) and the evidence in `why.md`.

**The recommendation below was wrong and the machine said so.** It proposed skipping identifiers
by prefix, on the theory that `MSIX\` carries a version and `ARP\` does not. Adobe writes
`ARP\Machine\X86\ILST_30_2_1` and `PHSP_27_2`, so the prefix rule keeps 119 decaying entries
while dropping 66. And the version churn turned out to be the *visible* fault, not the fault:
**none of the 186 was ever installable**, versioned or not. `winget show` refuses every one.
Recovering a real name by searching the catalogue does not rescue them either — 176 of 186 have
no match, 7 are ambiguous, 3 resolve.

Kept below as raised, because the reasoning that was refuted is the reason the rule is stated as
*"only what the manager can reinstall"* rather than *"nothing with a version in its name"*.

---

**`adopt` writes declarations that decay.** On Windows, `winget list` reports Add/Remove-Programs
and MSIX identities as pseudo-ids, and those ids **contain the version**. `adopt` wrote 186 of
them. One of them moved while this session was running:

```
adopted:       MSIX\Microsoft.Winget.Source_2026.805.1050.50_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe
installed now: MSIX\Microsoft.Winget.Source_2026.805.1206.6_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe
```

10:50 to 12:06 on the same day — winget's own source index updates constantly. The declared
name is now a package that does not exist, so Shall believes it is missing, tries to install it,
and cannot. It became two of the seven permanently-open journal operations in the run.

**This is not a harness artifact.** Any machine that runs `adopt` on Windows plants these, and
each one that updates becomes a line that can never converge — which then feeds Q34: one
unconvergeable declaration makes every later `install` fail.

The pseudo-ids are deliberately supported as *names* (`adopt.rs`, `guard.rs`,
`config/grammar/mod.rs` all carry tests). Supporting them as names is not the same as adopting
them as declarations.

**Recommendation** — `adopt` does not declare a package whose identity carries its own version,
because such a declaration is false the moment the package updates. The narrow form: skip
`MSIX\` and `ARP\` pseudo-ids at adoption and say how many were skipped and why.

## Q46

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**`upgrade` re-installed one package per command.** A manager with no upgrade-all verb upgrades
by re-installing what it has — `dart pub global activate <name>`, `npm install -g <name>` — and
`GenericUpgradable::upgrade` looped that over the installed set. Forty global npm packages meant
forty resolutions and forty registry conversations. It affects npm, pnpm, yarn, cargo and
pubdart, and it lives in `generic`, so `Q45`'s framing — *hand-written backends that never picked
up the generic batching* — did not cover it.

**Batching alone would have been a regression, and that is the point of the entry.** The loop
carried a deliberate comment: *"Deliberately not `?`: one package that will not reinstall must
not stop the other forty."* One command for forty packages fails all forty when one of them is
broken. So the batch is tried first and the loop is what happens when it fails: one command in
the ordinary case, per-package isolation exactly when something is wrong, which is the only time
it was ever worth paying for.

**How it was found matters more than the fix.** It was not in any sweep. `Q45` swept `install`
and `remove`; nobody had asked the same question of `upgrade`, and the sweep was reported as
complete twice before the third verb was checked at all. The lesson is the one `Q45`'s own
correction already recorded, one level up: **a sweep is only as complete as the list of things it
thought to ask about.**

**So the list was finally enumerated rather than remembered.** Every trait method that takes a
single name, and whether any caller loops it:

| verb | verdict |
|---|---|
| `install`, `remove` | per-item in five hand-written backends — `Q45` |
| `upgrade` | per-item in `generic` — this entry |
| `info` | looped, and correct: it is answered from the once-per-run listing memo, so N calls are **one** manager invocation |
| `lookup` | the N+1 behind `Q44`; batched wherever the manager has an outdated verb |
| `add_repo`, `remove_repo`, `get_dependencies` | not looped — `get_dependencies` reads as looped to a grep only because `handle_info` prints properties in a loop just above it |

That table is the deliverable, not the fix. Two of the six were wrong, and neither was found by
looking harder at the code that had already been examined — they were found by writing down every
verb and going through them.

**And then the same enumeration one layer out**, over every `for` loop in the tree whose own body
spawns a command (brace-matched, so a loop that merely *builds* an argv does not count — the
mistake that made `Q45`'s first sweep name thirteen backends instead of five). Thirty-four
survive, and the triage is:

- **`emacs` — fixed here.** Each install spawned a whole `emacs --batch` *and* a
  `package-refresh-contents`, which is a network fetch of the package archive. Ten packages meant
  ten startups and ten refreshes of an archive that had not changed. One `--batch` with a
  `dolist` does all of it, verified against GNU Emacs 29.3 in a container. **The names are
  interpolated into evaluated Lisp**, so every one is validated before any of them runs —
  a batch has to be refused whole, not part-way through, and that is pinned by a test.
- **`go` — must not be batched, and now there is a reason on file rather than a hunch.**
  `go install a@latest b@latest` answers *"All packages must be provided by the same module"*.
  Its per-item loop is correct.
- **Inherent, not deferred:** `btrfs`, `storage` (zfs/lvm), `setting`, `service`, `web`,
  `github`, `appimage`. One subvolume is one subvolume; one registry value is one write; one
  download is one download. These are not a to-do list and should not be re-raised as one.
- **Already ruled, with their reasons recorded:** `snap install` (chooses per package between
  `install` and `refresh --channel=`, D13/Q20) and `nix`'s indexed removal (positional indices
  renumber; no nix that still reports them was available to test).


## Q44

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: ask the manager once.** `Searchable::outdated_all` is the manager's own answer to the
whole question, wired for winget, scoop, choco, npm, pnpm, pip and gem. A manager without such
a verb keeps the per-package path — but concurrently, bounded by `max_parallel`, rather than one
after another. **771.4s to 25.6s on the same host, a 30x cut**, and `cargo` (which has no
outdated check at all) is the honest exception that still pays.

`None` from `outdated_all` means *this manager cannot be asked*; `Some(vec![])` means it was
asked and nothing is out of date. Conflating those would report a manager's whole set as current
the moment its verb was missing.

Where the manager answers, Shall does **not** re-compare the versions itself. The manager has
already decided; a second opinion from a version grammar it does not use is how `> 3.13.5` —
which is what winget really prints for `Python.Launcher` — becomes a wrong answer.

Wired for **thirteen** managers, and every parser but one is written against output captured
from the real tool rather than from documentation:

| manager | one call | fixture from |
|---|---|---|
| apt | `apt list --upgradable` | `ubuntu:24.04` container |
| dnf | `dnf check-update -q` (exits **100** when it finds some) | `fedora:latest` container |
| pacman | `pacman -Qu` | `shall-it-arch` container |
| apk | `apk version -l '<'` | `shall-it-alpine` container |
| zypper | `zypper --non-interactive list-updates` | `shall-it-opensuse` container |
| winget | `winget upgrade` | this host |
| scoop | `scoop status` | this host |
| choco | `choco outdated -r` | this host |
| pip | `pip list --outdated --format=json` | this host |
| gem | `gem outdated` | this host |
| npm / pnpm | `npm outdated -g --json` | this host |
| brew | `brew outdated --json=v2` | shape from docs; **banner behaviour** measured |

**brew is the one exception and it earned a defence.** Nothing was outdated in the container, so
the JSON shape comes from brew's documentation — but the container did show brew printing
`==> Auto-updating Homebrew...` ahead of the payload, which a strict parse would choke on. So the
parser locates the JSON rather than assuming the whole output is JSON, and that behaviour *is*
measured. `flatpak` is left unwired, and now for a measured reason rather than caution. It does support
`remote-ls --updates --columns=application,version`, and the column exists — but run against
flathub in a container, the version column comes back **empty**:

```
$ flatpak remote-ls flathub --app --columns=application,version | cat -A
ai.jan.Jan$
ai.lmstudio.lm-studio$
```

The `$` sits straight after the id: no tab, no version. Most flathub apps carry no version in the
remote listing, so flatpak can say *that* something has an update and not *to what*. An `Outdated`
row needs both, so flatpak keeps the per-package path. `cargo` is the other honest exception — no
outdated check exists at all.

**The sweep is now complete rather than opportunistic, and that distinction was a real gap.** The
first pass wired the managers there happened to be fixtures for and was written up as though it
had covered the field. Every remaining backend was then asked the same question, and most of the
answers are *no such verb* — which is information, not an omission:

| manager | answer | how it was settled |
|---|---|---|
| **composer** | `global outdated --format=json` — **wired** | container, with a real global package |
| bun | `bun outdated` reports a *workspace's* dependencies; Shall manages bun **globals** | container |
| yarn | `yarn global outdated` â†’ `error Invalid subcommand` | container |
| uv | no such verb (`upgrade --dry-run` does not exist) | container |
| pipx | `upgrade` / `upgrade-all` only — nothing that *lists* | container |
| pixi | `global update` only — nothing that lists | container |
| flatpak | has the verb; the version column comes back **empty** | container |
| cargo | none | documented |
| dotnet | no outdated verb for tools | this host |

**Unprobed, and named rather than left implied:** `mas` and `macports` (macOS), `pkg`,
`pkg_add`, `pkgin` (BSD), `emerge`, `eopkg`, `guix`, `slackpkg` (distro-specific), and
`asdf`, `krew`, `luarocks`, `mix`, `nimble`, `pubdart`, `spack`. Several of those plainly do have
one — `port outdated`, `mas outdated`, `eopkg list-upgrades`, `mix hex.outdated` — but no host or
container here runs them, and this session's standing rule is that a parser ships against
captured output or not at all. They stay on the per-package path, which is slower and correct.

Custom backends get the same field (`outdated_args`), because U2's claim is that a custom backend
is a first-class peer of a built-in, and a capability built-ins have and definitions cannot
declare makes that claim false. **And it works with the verb and without it:** no `outdated_args`
means `None`, so the caller asks per package. A gap found while testing that — `Searchable` was
attached only when `search_args` was set, so a definition declaring an outdated verb and no search
got no capability at all and its updates were silently unreportable. The gate now admits either,
and `search` refuses by name when it was never configured rather than answering "no results".

**`list --outdated` asks per package what every manager will answer in one call.**
`compute_outdated` is a serial `for` loop over installed packages calling `s.lookup(&p.name)`
once each — many of those are network round trips to a registry.

Measured on this host, same machine, same minute:

```
shall list --outdated : 771.4s
shall list            :   2.9s
```

**266x**, and the 771s is not parallelism lost — it is the wrong question asked N times. Nearly
every manager has a one-call answer:

| manager | one call |
|---|---|
| apt | `apt list --upgradable` |
| dnf | `dnf check-update` (exit 100 means "there are some" — a benign exit) |
| pacman | `pacman -Qu` |
| winget | `winget upgrade` |
| choco | `choco outdated` |
| scoop | `scoop status` |
| npm / pnpm | `npm outdated -g --json` |
| pip | `pip list --outdated --format=json` |
| brew | `brew outdated --json` |
| gem | `gem outdated` |
| flatpak | `flatpak remote-ls --updates` |

Two separate wins, and they compose: **batch** turns N registry lookups into one manager call,
and **parallel** runs the remaining ~10 manager calls at once instead of in sequence. The
2026-08-02 ruling — *as parallel as possible, as efficient as possible, as fast as possible;
restructure if it takes that* — covers the second; the first is not parallelism at all.

`cargo` is the honest exception: it has no built-in outdated check, so its packages stay on the
per-package path or go unreported, and that should be said rather than papered over.

## Q45

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: one command for the batch.** Built for all five, and three of them verified by running
the real tool in a container rather than by asserting the argv Shall builds:

```
nix   : nix profile remove hello ripgrep
        -> removed 2 packages, kept 17 packages          (rc=0, jq untouched)
mise  : mise use -g -- jq@latest shellcheck@latest
        -> tools: jq@1.8.2, shellcheck@0.11.0            (one config write, rc=0)
        mise uninstall -- jq@latest shellcheck@latest    -> both gone, rc=0
brew  : brew install --dry-run jq ripgrep
        -> one dependency resolution covering both       (rc=0)
```

**`vscode` and `snap` are argv-tested only**, and that is weaker. VS Code's repeated
`--install-extension` and `snap remove a b` are both documented and unambiguous, but no
container here runs an Electron host or snapd, so what is pinned is the command Shall builds,
not the manager accepting it. Said plainly rather than left to look like the other three.

**Two things were deliberately left alone.** `snap install` chooses per package between
`install` and `refresh --channel=` depending on what is already present (D13, Q20), so those
specs genuinely cannot share a command. And nix's *indexed* removal keeps its
highest-index-first loop: positional indices renumber, no nix that still reports them was
available to prove a batched form safe, and a wrong guess there removes a package the user did
not name. Modern nix reports no indices at all, so the batched by-name path is the one that runs.



**Five backends run one command per package where the manager takes a list.** The generic
backend is correct — `install_group` builds one argv with every name, with deliberate exceptions
for per-line version pins and signature opt-outs. Five hand-written ones never got it:

```rust
// brew.rs:62
async fn install(&self, specs: &[PackageSpec], _sudo: bool) -> Result<()> {
    for spec in specs {
        ...run_exclusive("brew", &["install", one_name]).await?;
```

`brew install a b c` resolves the dependency graph once. One at a time is N resolutions and,
because it is `run_exclusive`, N serialised lock acquisitions.

| can batch, does not | why it is worth it |
|---|---|
| **brew** | `brew install a b c` / `brew uninstall a b c`; one resolve, one lock |
| **nix** | `nix profile install` takes several installables |
| **mise** | `mise use -g a@1 b@2` |
| **vscode** | `code --install-extension a --install-extension b` — a repeated flag, one process |
| **snap** | `snap install a b`, `snap remove a b` |

**Not on the list, and not a to-do:** `btrfs`, `setting`, `storage`, `web`, `github` are not
package managers — one subvolume is one subvolume, one download is one download. `emacs` and
`go` are maybes with real caveats (`go install` constrains multiple `@version` arguments) and
are left alone rather than guessed at.

**The first sweep of this said thirteen backends and named `dnf` and `pacman` among them. That
was wrong.** The detector matched a `for` loop followed anywhere in the function by a `run(`
call — and `dnf`'s loop is `for name in &names { args.push(name) }`, which *builds* the batched
argv. Both dnf and pacman batch correctly. Re-run with brace matching so a loop counts only when
the invocation is inside its own body. Recorded because the wrong version of this entry existed
for an hour and the correction is the useful part: a per-item loop and a loop that assembles one
command look identical to a grep.


## Q40

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: a read that exits non-zero having said nothing on either stream is a failure, not an
empty result.**
`run_output` deliberately ignored exit status — reads tolerate a non-zero exit because "no such
package" and "no results" are legitimate non-zero replies. But it tolerated the *silent* ones
too, and those are not replies at all.

Measured, without Shall in the picture: 16 concurrent `winget list` from a cold start, 3 of them
exit `0x8A150001` in ~310ms having written **zero bytes to either stream**. Through Shall that
became `Ok("")` â†’ a parser finding no packages â†’ `list_installed` answering `Ok(vec![])`. Nothing
in the chain believed anything had failed:

```
round 1 : rows min=0 max=280   EMPTY_LISTINGS=1/16
        rc=0  ms=2285  rows=0   <-- `shall list --backend winget`, on a machine with 280
```

So a transient winget hiccup did not make Shall report an error — it made Shall believe the
machine was empty, at exit 0. The flaky `info` test that started this (`info winget:7zip.7zip`
denying a row `list` had just printed) is the mildest symptom of it; `check drift` seeing nothing
installed is not.

The rule is narrow on purpose, and the first attempt was one notch too wide. Keying on an empty
*stdout* alone made `Get-ComputerRestorePoint` fatal — unelevated it exits 1 with `Access
denied` on stderr and nothing on stdout — and that failed a whole `sync` which had no business
caring. The suite caught it within the hour. A command that **said** something has described
its own situation and its caller may have a reading for it; silence on *both* streams is the
one case with no second reading, because nothing expresses "you have none of these" by saying
nothing at all and failing.

**The two readers deliberately differ, and that is worth stating because this repo treats two of
everything as a defect.** `search_output` already refused a non-zero exit that complained on
stderr, and `run_output` does not. A search that complains has failed to consult its index, and
an empty result read as "this manager does not have it" hands a bare name to a lower-priority
manager (V.7c) — the emptiness *is* the answer there, so it has to be trustworthy. A listing's
caller may have somewhere else to go: the snapshot check that asked for restore points and was
denied does not need them. If those two ever want the same rule, it should be `search_output`'s,
reached by fixing the callers that currently rely on tolerance — not by loosening the search. Fixed in `run_output` for every read, and in
the three callers that were separately turning an error into a negative: `info` (which printed
"is not installed on this machine"), `list` (which dropped the manager's rows), and
`hook-reconcile` (which recorded nothing). `planner::installed_sets` was checked and is
**correct as it stands** — it treats an unqueryable backend as "assume installed" so removals are
still scheduled, which is the documented safe direction.

## Q41

**Ruled: classify retryability by exit code as well as by output text, and retry a read that is
classified transient.**

`ExitPolicy` matched *text* — transient markers, permanent markers, absent markers — against a
haystack built from both streams. The failure above writes nothing to either, so the haystack is
empty, every list misses, and `retryability` returns `Unknown`. The one signal that existed, the
exit code, was read by nothing but `is_benign`. **The classifier was looking at the wrong axis
for the only failure that has no words.**

What a manager *says* still outranks what it returns: `retryability_of` consults the code only
when the text classified nothing, because a command that named its problem has described it
better than a number can.

**Retry is for reads only, and that is not a convenience.** A read is idempotent — asking a
manager what it has, twice, costs a second. A mutation retried on a guess installs something
twice. The measured failure is a cold-start collision that a warm winget does not reproduce (3 of
16 on the first burst, 0 of 32 on the next two), so the second attempt is usually the entire fix.
`read_retry_attempts` defaults to 3; `1` disables it.

Only `0x8A150001` is listed as transient, because it is the only one measured. Winget documents
many more codes and guessing which of them a retry could help would be inventing policy from a
header file — an over-eager entry costs real seconds on every failure that will never pass.

## Q42

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: reads get their own bound on silence.** `query_idle_timeout_secs`, default **120**, `0`
disables, and it is capped by `command_idle_timeout_secs` because the outer bound fires first
anyway.

One number was doing two jobs. `command_idle_timeout_secs` is 900 and the comment beside it names
why: `Checkpoint-Computer` is silent for its entire run, so a mutation needs that much rope. A
read does not — `winget list` takes 1.5s here, 2.6s under sixteen-way contention, and `apt list
--installed` under a second. Fifteen minutes of rope for a one-second question means a wedged
listing costs fifteen minutes to learn what two could have told you. The 25-minute `winget list`
recorded under `cargo test` on 2026-07-31 is the case: it *did* eventually return, and waiting
was still the wrong trade.

120 is ~46x the slowest read measured on this host — wide enough that a fat machine on a slow
disk is never cut off, narrow enough that a hang is a two-minute wait. It is a key rather than a
constant because a CI runner and a laptop have different answers, exactly as the bound above it
does.

## Q43

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: negotiate once, per backend, per run.** Ask for the machine-readable listing; if the
manager refuses, read the text listing and say so at `debug`. Built for all three — pixi
(`global list --json`), dotnet (`tool list --format json`), scoop (`export`). The listing memo
makes "once per run" free: a run asks each manager for its listing exactly once either way.

The negotiation needed its own primitive. `probe_output` is the only reader that treats a
non-zero exit as a failure regardless of what was printed — because here the failure *is* the
answer being sought, and every other reader deliberately hands a complaint back as an empty
result (`Q40`). Each JSON parser is a separate function from its text sibling, never one parser
made lenient, and each is pinned by a test asserting the two agree about the same machine —
including about the rows that are not packages, which is where scoop's old scar was.

**Three backends parse a human table where the tool offers a machine format, and Shall cannot
safely ask for it.** The sweep of all 40 registered backends found exactly three gaps, all
verified on this host:

| backend | Shall parses today | available instead | shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pixi** | `global list` | `global list --json` | box-drawing tree (`└── ripgrep: 15.2.0`) to JSON |
| **dotnet** | `tool list --global` | `tool list --format json` | fixed-width columns to JSON |
| **scoop** | `list` | `scoop export` | fixed-width columns to JSON |

Everything else is already machine-readable or has nothing to offer. **Already fine:** npm, pnpm,
pip, pipx, composer (JSON); choco (`list -r`, `name|version`), apt (`dpkg-query -f=`), luarocks
(`--porcelain`), opam (`--short`), cabal (`--simple-output`), spack (`--format`). **Checked and
there is no machine format:** gem, cargo (`install --list`; its `--message-format json` is for
diagnostics, not for the listing), uv, yarn, mas, and `winget list` itself.

**Why this is not simply a config edit.** Every one of the three is a *version-dependent flag* —
`--format json` needs dotnet SDK 10, `--json` a recent pixi, and scoop's export only emits JSON in
current builds — and **Shall has no capability probe.** There is no version gate, no
`supports_flag`, nothing. Passing an unsupported flag to an older tool makes the command fail with
a usage message on stderr and nothing on stdout, and `Q40` deliberately leaves *that* shape alone:
a read that complained is handed to its caller as an empty result. So shipping any of these three
blind would reproduce the exact defect `Q40` was raised to fix — a manager silently reporting an
empty machine — on a different axis, and only for users on older tooling, who are the least likely
to be reading release notes.

**Recommendation — negotiate once, per backend, per run.** Ask for the machine format; if the
command *fails* (a status-aware read, not `run_output`), fall back to the text form and remember
that answer for the rest of the run. It costs one extra failed invocation on old tooling and
nothing at all on current, needs no version table to go stale, and is testable from both sides. It
is a second code path per backend, which this repo is right to be suspicious of — but the
alternatives are a version table nobody will maintain, pinning minimum versions of tools Shall
does not control, or never improving a parser again.

**The measured argument for bothering at all:** the scoop parser already carries a scar from this
exact class. `scoop list` leaves Version and Source empty for a failed install and keeps the row
forever; read by whitespace-splitting it became a package named `jq` at version `2026-07-21`, and
`adopt` wrote it into a manifest for software that was never on PATH. The fix was to slice by
header offsets — correct, and still parsing a table drawn for a human when the same tool will hand
over JSON on request.

**Not found: a second member of the `Q36` family.** winget is the only backend that merges a
*foreign inventory* into its listing — the ARP and MSIX rows it synthesises from the registry.
Every other manager lists what it installed and can reinstall it. `choco export` exists and adds
nothing over `choco list -r`. The `ManualListing::ExportFile` seam stays because `brew bundle
dump` is the likely second member and there is no macOS host here to check it on.


## Q37

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: check the destination before spending the network.** The refusal is a pure function of
the destination, so it is asked before the first byte in all three download backends —
`github:`, `web:` and `appimage:` — through one `ensure_deployable`, which `deploy_executable`
also calls so the two can never ask different questions.

One case still pays: a `github:` release resolving to *several* deployable artifacts names each
one after the program inside it, which no metadata can answer before the archive is open. A
single-artifact release — which is what `github:sharkdp/fd` is, and what the 180 seconds were
spent on — is answered from the repo name alone.

`tests/deploy_refusal_precedes_the_download_tests.rs` scans the three backends for the ordering,
because the defect is an ordering and a missing line and neither is visible inside the function
that refuses. Below is why it was raised.

**The `github:` backend downloads the artifact, then refuses to deploy it.**
`deploy_executable` takes an already-downloaded, already-extracted `src`, and its refusal —
`is_ours(dest, owned_root, recorded)` — reads only the *destination*. It needs zero downloaded
bytes, and it runs after the download.

Measured inside one `heal`: **60.9s and 119.1s**, back to back, both ending in

```
could not recover github:sharkdp/fd — refusing to deploy `fd.exe`:
    C:\Users\Administrator\.local\bin\fd.exe already exists and Shall did not create it.
```

**180 of that `heal`'s 201 seconds were spent fetching a file it was always going to reject.**
It is silent for all of it, at zero CPU with no child process — an in-process `reqwest`
download, which is why it looks exactly like a wedge and why three earlier stalls were
misdiagnosed. `core/http.rs` gives downloads no whole-request timeout, correctly: a big download
must not be capped by wall clock. But that makes an avoidable download unbounded *and* silent.

**Recommendation** — check the destination before spending the network. The ownership test is
already a pure function of `dest`; hoist it above the fetch. Every download backend that
deploys onto a shared bin directory has the same ordering.

## Q38

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: a failed reconcile is a non-zero exit, on `watch` as everywhere.** `watch --once` returns
the reconcile's error. The looping form still warns and carries on — one failed tick is not a
reason to stop reconciling, and it has no exit code anyone reads.

The sibling one line up, `watch: git pull failed`, stays a warning on purpose: the reconcile after
it still converged the machine to the manifests this host holds, which is what `watch` promises.
Below is why it was raised.

`shall -y watch --once` printed

```
WARN watch: reconcile failed: `scoop` failed (exit 1): Couldn't find manifest for '...'
```

and **exited 0**.

A scheduled `watch` is the least-watched surface in the program — that is its purpose — so an
exit code that says "fine" after a failed reconcile is the Q28 defect class at the one place
nobody is reading the output.

**Recommendation** — a failed reconcile is a non-zero exit, on `watch` as everywhere else.


## Q39

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, both halves, and built the same day.**

**The second half, ruled: a bare `adopt` does not take a machine's services.** The rule it needed
already existed — `adopt` refuses a backend that cannot separate a user's choices from its
dependency closure — and this is that question one step along: not *can you tell a dependency
from a decision*, but *is being on the machine evidence of a decision at all*. The service
backend answered "yes I can" while its own `manual_source` read *"no init records which you
chose"*.

A default and not a refusal. Measured on the same host, isolated config and state:

```
shall adopt                          316 declarations, 0 services, and a line naming
                                     the backend it skipped and how to ask for it
shall adopt service                  149
shall adopt service --enabled-only   113
```

`--enabled-only` reads the machine's own record of what it starts at boot, in one command rather
than one per service. It drops the 36 demand-start services — `smphost` among them — and does
**not** drop `gpsvc`, which Windows marks `Automatic` and stops anyway when it idles. That is
Windows disagreeing with itself, and it is recorded rather than papered over: the filter narrows
the guess, it does not turn the list into a record of anybody's decision. V.134.

**The first half, ruled and built earlier the same day:**

**Ruled: already being in the state the line asks for is success, and Shall asks before it acts.**
Two changes, and the first is the one that mattered:

1. **`in_effect` learned `service:`.** A `service:` line was `unverifiable`, and unverifiable
   *places* — so every adopted service was applied on the first sync whatever the machine looked
   like. It now asks the init, off the listing this run already has: `@status=running` is in
   effect when the init reports the service, `@status=stopped` when it does not. `@status=restarted`
   is a transition no listing records and `@enabled=` is a second axis no shipped init reports,
   so both stay unverifiable — a line that declares either is still applied.
2. **The service backend forgives the codes that mean "already there".** `sc start` on a running
   service returns **1056** and `sc stop` on a stopped one **1062**; both are declared per verb in
   `init_providers.toml`, because each is an ordinary failure on the other verb. The other four
   shipped inits report the same case as exit 0 and declare nothing, which is now pinned rather
   than left blank.

Measured on this host, after `shall adopt` wrote 150 `service:` lines out of 207 declarations:

```
plan  ->  150 resource(s) to place     (before)
plan  ->    2 resource(s) to place     (after)
```

The two are real drift — `gpsvc` and `smphost`, trigger-start services that Windows had idled out
in the twenty minutes since `adopt` ran. Which is the best argument yet for the half below.

**Aligned with it, and found by it:** `Extras::changes` short-circuited on "never applied" and
placed without probing, while `Dependents::apply` has never consulted the ledger at all — so
`plan` promised 150 placements `sync` would not have made. The probe now comes first in both, and
the ledger answers only what the probe cannot.

**Still open — and it is a real ruling, because it changes what `adopt` means on Windows:** should
`adopt` take every running service in the first place? 150 of them, none chosen by anyone, two of
them transient by design. Combined with Q36's version-bearing pseudo-ids it is most of what
`adopt` produces on this machine. Below is the original entry.

**After `shall adopt`, every `shall install` fails.**

`adopt` on this host wrote 517 lines, of which:

```
150  service:<name>@status=running      every running Windows service
180  winget:MSIX\... / winget:ARP\...   version-bearing pseudo-ids (Q36)
```

Converging a `service:X@status=running` line runs the `windows-sc` provider's
`start = [["sc", "start", "{name}"]]`. On a service that is **already running** — which all 150
are, because that is why `adopt` adopted them — `sc` returns **1056**:

```
Error: `sc` failed (exit 1056): [SC] StartService FAILED 1056:
An instance of the service is already running.
```

`1056` is `ERROR_SERVICE_ALREADY_RUNNING`. **It is the desired state.** For a declarative
converger it is the definition of success, and it appears nowhere in the codebase. There is a
`benign_exits` mechanism — `msiexec` uses `1605/1614/1618/1641/3010`, `winget` its negative codes
— and `for_manager` has no `"service"` arm at all, so the service backend runs on
`ExitPolicy::default()` with `benign_exits` empty.

Then Q34 does the rest: `install X` converges the whole manifest, one member fails, the
transaction fails, and the user is told that **X** failed. Observed on `bun`, `dotnet`, `pnpm`,
`winget` and `yarn` in one run — none of which had anything wrong with them.

**This is what remained after the exit-policy gap was fixed**, and it is the larger of the two
cascade sources. The first run's failures were attributed to the scoop leftover; the confirmation
run shows that was only part of it.

**The family, and it is not only `1056`:**

- `sc start` on a running service â†’ `1056`, desired state.
- `sc stop` on a stopped service â†’ `1062` (`ERROR_SERVICE_NOT_ACTIVE`), also the desired state, and
  `stop = [["sc", "stop", "{name}"]]` has the same shape.
- Unelevated, the same convergence returns `5` (access denied) instead — measured here on
  `Spooler`. That one is a real failure and should stay one, but it means an unelevated `adopt`
  produces a manifest that cannot converge either.

**Recommendation** — two parts, and the first needs no ruling in spirit because it is what
convergence *means*:

1. Give the service backend an exit policy whose `benign_exits` carry `1056` for start and `1062`
   for stop. Already being in the declared state is success.
2. **`adopt` should not adopt every running service.** 150 of them, none chosen by the user, is
   not a manifest anyone wrote — and combined with Q36's 180 decaying pseudo-ids it means 64% of
   what `adopt` produced on this machine cannot converge. This half is a real ruling: it changes
   what `adopt` means on Windows.

## Q47

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-05, and built the same day.**

**Ruled: `adopt` takes OS-essential packages as live lines.** The commented-out second section
of `modules/adopted.txt` is gone. What the OS calls essential is declared like anything else,
Shall keeps it, and the guard is what refuses to remove it — the same arrangement E7 already
ruled for `protected_packages`, now applied to the branch four lines below it in the same `if`.

The owner's framing was the ruling: *"it should be able to adopt OS-essential stuff, just that
then it has to keep that profile active."* Adoption is the claim that Shall keeps the thing.
Refusing to make that claim about the packages the machine cannot boot without is backwards.

**The stated reason for the comment character was already false.** It read: *"not something to
hand someone as a line whose deletion means uninstall."* But `guard::protection_of` refuses to
remove anything a backend reports as essential regardless of what the manifest says, and the
only way past it is an explicit `unprotected_packages` entry. The comment was defending against
a deletion the guard already blocks.

**What it cost was not false.** A commented line is not a declaration, so Shall had no opinion
about those 33 packages at all — no drift detection, nothing to heal, nothing to put back. The
packages most worth keeping were the only ones outside the model.

**What changed, and what deliberately did not:**

- The `os_essential` skip branch in `Adopter::discover_scoped` is deleted, and with it the
  `guard::essential_names` call — one subprocess per backend per `adopt` run, asked for an
  answer nothing consults any more. The guard re-asks at removal time, where it matters.
- The manifest header names the exception rather than hiding it: *"a package you protected, or
  one the OS itself calls essential, is declared here so Shall keeps it — deleting its line
  stops Shall keeping it, and the guard still refuses to remove it."* The old header's flat
  promise that deleting a line uninstalls was already untrue for protected packages, which
  `adopt` has taken as live lines since E7.
- **The guard is untouched.** Nine refusals, same order, same `unprotected_packages` override.
  Adoption changed; removal did not.

**Sibling swept in the same change:** `check unmanaged` printed *"N package(s) the OS reports as
essential are left alone"* using `found.skipped.len()` — the total of *every* skip reason,
including "you already declare it" and "its manager reports a name no line can hold". A count
explained by a reason belonging to none of its inputs, which is the exact defect `by_reason`
was written to fix inside `adopt` and which was never carried across to the reader beside it.
It now prints the same per-reason breakdown `adopt` does.

Rule in II.9; why in V.137. Related: `Q31`, which this shrinks and does not close.

## Y11

**Status: ANSWERED — built and ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as F-5, ranked second on the quality axis. Accurate on the
mechanism; one-directional about which path loses, and the review's proposed remedy is
explicitly not what shipped.

**Y11 — When one job has two implementations, which one is right?** Neither, reliably. The
question is what makes the second one stop existing.

A backend here is a `ManagerConfig` row — about 56 lines of table over shared machinery — or a
hand-written module averaging 403. F-5's claim was that nine of the twenty-two exemptions are
refuted by the code beside them, and it checked three: `dnf`, `pacman` and `xbps`. All three
check out, and the three modules are gone: 1,223 lines of Rust for 272 of table.

**`src/` came out about level on the change (+41 lines), and that is the honest number.** What
left as bespoke Rust went back as machinery every backend can reach, as parsers moved next to
their siblings with their fixtures, and as three new gates. A conversion that shrinks the tree
is a pleasant side effect; the one that counts removed a second way of doing the job.

**RULED, part one: one path per backend. A capability the machinery lacks is a field, never a
reason to keep a second implementation.**

That is the rule the ratchet's header already stated for the eight conversions of 2026-08-04,
now binding. These three cost four fields, and all four are available to every backend
including a user's own row in `adapters/backends.toml`:

- **`CacheClean`** — how a manager empties its download cache, with its own binary, because
  Void empties its cache with `xbps-remove` and apt with `apt-get`.
- **`DependsProbe`** — the argv *and* the reader, because dnf prints one bare name per line,
  pacman prints several on one labelled row, and apt prints one per labelled line. One parser
  lenient enough for all three is one parser that reads a malformed answer in one shape as a
  valid answer in another.
- **`OutdatedProbe::silence_is_none`** — `pacman -Qu` exits non-zero with nothing on either
  stream to mean *nothing is out of date*, which is exactly the shape `Q40` calls a failed read.
  Translated back for the manager whose meaning is known, rather than by loosening the rule for
  every read in the program.
- **`{name_component}`** — a repository name that becomes a path segment. Both hand-written
  modules validated it; the shared repo path did not, because until now no row put a name in a
  path. `../../etc/cron.d/x` is an ordinary argument and a directory escape.

**RULED, part two: the record of what a backend runs is checked against the table that knows
the answer.**

This is the finding under the finding, and F-5 did not name it. `registry.rs`'s argv table
drives every backend against a mock and records the argv it would have run — good instrument,
one of the better ones here. It recorded `Runs("dnf install -y jq")` in the same list as
`Runs("apt install -y -- jq")` and never asked `core::argv`, which is the one file that knows
`dnf` ends its options at `--`. The gate held the defect as its own expectation. Every recorded
invocation is now cross-checked, with a written exemption for `emacs`, whose operand is the
value of `--eval` and not an operand at all.

**The review's frame was one-directional, and that is the correction.** F-5 read the split as
*data path good, hand-written path lossy*. Scoping the conversion found two live defects of the
same class running the other way:

- **`clean_cache` existed only on the hand-written path.** Six modules had the verb;
  `ManagerConfig` had no field, so all forty rows answered `Unsupported` and `shall clean-cache`
  told every Debian, Alpine, SUSE and Node user that no backend on the machine had a cache.
  Eighteen backends can clear one now.
- **The exclusive lock keyed on the program, not the manager.** OpenBSD's `pkg_add` and
  `pkg_delete` took two different flocks over one package database. Every hand-written module
  had keyed on the manager; only the shared machinery had not. `xbps.rs` had it right and would
  have lost it in conversion.

**RULED, part three: an exemption's reason is checked against the module it excuses.**

The ratchet's only assertion about a reason was `why.len() > 60`. `pacman.rs` claimed the
removal guard needed its essential data and had no `essential()` impl; `dnf.rs` described
`ManualListing::Command { format: SameAsInstalled }` in prose; `xbps.rs` named three fields that
exist. Each entry now carries a `proof` — text that must appear in the module — and the check is
self-tested against a planted falsehood before it is trusted (IV.1).

**Deliberately not done.** F-5's proposed change was *"move the 40 rows into `onboarder.rs`'s
TOML format"*. Refused for now, and not as a matter of taste: the rows carry parser closures
(`PackageReader`, `NameReader`) that a TOML file cannot hold, and moving compile-checked data
into a runtime-parsed file trades a build failure for a startup failure. The rows are already
data; where they live is a separate question and it does not have a bug attached.

**Also not done:** `dnf`, `pacman` and `xbps` still report dependencies, and the test asserting
the other fifteen system managers ask nothing is unchanged. Under `Y9` a dependency is reported
and never planned from, so the asymmetry costs one subprocess on `shall info` and buys the
`Dependencies:` line. Removing it is a feature a user would notice, which is not something to
settle inside a refactor.

Rule in II.22 and II.12b; reason in V.142.

## Y12

**Status: ANSWERED — built and ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as F-3, ranked second on the accuracy axis. Accurate on the
site it named, and understated: it found one of four, and the one it missed is the worst.

**Y12 — When a plan is asked what to remove, what is it comparing against?** Whatever the caller
handed it, and until now the caller had no way to say what that was.

`ChangePlanner::plan` computes removals as `managed âˆ’ desired`. The signature took
`Option<Scope>`, and `None` carried two facts that have nothing to do with each other: *do not
filter the desired set*, and *reap every backend on the box*. Five of the eight call sites passed
`None`. Four of the five wanted only the first.

`planner.rs:39` recorded the choice and its reason: *"Absence of a scope is `Option::None` rather
than a variant: as an enum variant it was an implicit spare-everything switch that `matches!`
early-returns skipped past, so adding a variant produced no compiler error."* The objection was
real. The answer to it was not — an `Option` is a spare-everything switch too, and a quieter one,
because nothing about writing `None` looks like a decision.

**What was live:**

- **`app/shell/mod.rs:269` — the transient shell, and it is not the same bug as the other three.**
  `provision_transient_env` builds a desired map holding **only the packages the shell was asked
  for**, then planned it as a whole-machine converge. Every other managed package on the box
  became a `Remove` node, handed to `engine.sync(…, GuardScope::Sync)`. `shall shell ripgrep`
  proposed to uninstall the machine. `max_removals` was the only thing in the way, and a ceiling
  is not a rule. The planner's own comment four hundred lines below describes this exact
  combination as the thing that must never happen.
- **`verbs/plan.rs:202` — `plan`/`apply`.** The frozen plan carried removals for every backend
  `priority` does not name, and `apply` carried them out later, against a machine that had never
  agreed to Shall touching that manager. Its sibling three lines up in the same file had the fix
  **and the comment explaining it** — *"`status` reports what a full `sync` would do, so it
  scopes drift the same way"* — and did not get it.
- **`verbs/setup.rs:569` — `upgrade --canary`.** The one command that promises to roll back was
  the one most likely to need to.
- **`app/profile.rs:462` — `activate`/`deactivate`/`profile save`,** the site the review named.
  `sync` confined removals to the managers this host lists and `activate` did not, which made the
  narrower-sounding command the more destructive one.

**RULED, part one: a plan says what it is computed over, and it is not optional.**

`PlanScope` replaces `Option<Scope>` with three cases a caller has to choose between:

- **`Whole(HostBackends)`** — the machine's whole declaration set. Drift is real, bounded by the
  backends `priority` names.
- **`Narrowed(Scope)`** — one profile or module. `desired` is filtered down to it, and nothing is
  removed, because a package outside the scope is outside the question.
- **`JustThese`** — a set of packages that is not the config at all. Installs only.

**RULED, part two: the case that reaps cannot be written without the list that bounds it.**

`HostBackends` is a newtype, and `StateResolver::host_backends` is the only thing in `src/` that
mints one — gated by `planner_scope_enumeration_tests`, because the compiler cannot tell a list
that came from `priority` from one somebody assembled by hand. `priority`'s promise is written in
the error a new user reads when the file is missing: *"Listed means Shall uses it. Not listed
means Shall does not touch it at all."* Four commands broke it, and none of them had to hold the
list to do so.

**RULED, part three: the enumeration reports a scope it cannot read, rather than skipping it.**

The gate found this hole in itself on its first run. `upgrade --canary` bound its scope to a
variable above the call, so no `PlanScope::` literal appeared in the argument list and the scan
passed over the site in silence — a clean report about a file it had not read. An unreadable site
now fails, and the canary names both of its variants at the call. This is the "check that cannot
fail" family (F-2) caught in a check written to close it.

**Where the tests can and cannot reach.** `verbs/` is private to the binary (`main.rs:10`), so
two of the four sites are unreachable from any of the test binaries; they are covered by the
source enumeration instead, and that is a workaround for a module boundary in the wrong place,
not a preference. Recorded here because it is the second finding this month whose test had to be
written sideways for that reason.

**Behaviour a user could notice, and it is a narrowing in all four cases.** `upgrade --canary`,
`plan`/`apply`, `activate` and `deactivate` now leave alone any managed package whose backend
`priority` does not list, and say so in the skipped list rather than in silence (II.10). No
command removes anything it did not before.

Rule in II.7; reason in V.143.

## Y13

**Status: ANSWERED — built and ruled 2026-08-06.** Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as **"The `Converge` engine"**, ranked first on the quality
axis and framed as the review's central structural finding. Accurate on both of its consequences
— and understated on one of them, which was five copies and is seven. Its headline, the rename,
is refused, with the evidence below.

**Y13 — Is there one engine underneath the six things Shall converges, and if not, why not?**

The review's claim is a causal chain: the product converges declared objects, the central trait is
called `Installable`, *"there was no shared noun to hang an engine on, so each noun grew its own"*,
and therefore four hand-written converge loops exist. It lists two structural consequences and one
remedy. The consequences are real. The remedy is not the thing that caused them.

**RULED, part one: a statement declares which phase of a sync its work happens in, and the order
of the phases is a type.**

`verbs/sync.rs` already carried the bill in its own words — *"every statement kind added since was
missed by one of them: extras, then `exec:`, then `dotfiles:`, then `firewall:` — four times."*
That comment was written when the dry-run branch's duplicate phase list was folded into the real
one. It diagnosed the duplicate list correctly and did not notice that **three more copies of the
same fact were still standing**: `dependents()` spelled out `Shim | Service | Link | Setting` in a
`matches!`, each `has_*` helper spelled out its own kind, and `has_non_package_work` was five
`||`s naming five kinds. A fifth kind added to the grammar would have compiled against all four,
and the review's own note — *"`resolve.rs:29`, seven `filter_map` accessors, and
`has_non_package_work` as a hand-written `||` chain the compiler never checks"* — is exactly
right.

`Statement::phase()` is an exhaustive match, the same move `Statement::key()` had already made for
identity. A kind added to the grammar does not compile until somebody says where in a sync it
belongs. `Phase`'s variants are declared in run order and `Ord` is that order, so
`has_non_package_work` is `phase > Phase::Packages` — a comparison, extended by nobody. The
dispatch in `apply_non_package_phases` matches exhaustively over the enum and iterates it, so the
order is the type's rather than the order somebody typed the calls.

The one exclusion that was deliberate is now *expressible*: `repo:` is not "work after the
packages" because it is phase 1 and ran before the plan. It had in fact been forgotten — the exit's
own comment said so and worked around it by counting placements separately — and the workaround is
gone.

**RULED, part two: K17 has one mechanism, and writing it again is a build failure.**

The review counted five registries. There are **seven**: firewall adapters, init providers,
settings stores, snapshot providers, prereq rows, bootstrap rows and secret providers. Seven row
*types* is right and stays — one schema holding `allow`/`deny` and `start`/`stop` and
`read`/`write`/`reset` would be a struct of twenty optional fields. Seven copies of everything
asked *about* rows is not, and **four of the five shared questions had already been answered
differently**:

- **`[[secret]]` had no `os` field at all.** Six siblings could be confined to a platform. The one
  table whose rows are handed a plaintext secret could not.
- **Three tables refused a duplicate name and three kept it silently.** In `[[secret]]`, which of
  two `vault` blocks answered was decided by file order, and nothing said so.
- **The OS question had two spellings**, one reading `std::env::consts::OS` and one taking it as a
  parameter — so the Windows arm of four tables could only ever be exercised on Windows.
- **The built-in snapshot rows did not clear the floor a user's row clears**, which is the K17/U1
  invariant written in that file's own header.

`core/adapter.rs` is that mechanism. A row says what it is; the module answers everything else.
And the gate is not a ledger of the seven tables — a ledger catches an eighth being *added*, and
what actually happened seven times was a table quietly growing its own copy while its author did
something reasonable in the file in front of them. So the duplication itself fails the build.

**RULED, part three: the rename is refused, and `Installable` keeps its name.**

The review's headline is *"the name is the mechanism"*. Checked, and it is not:

- **The convergence decision is already shared, in exactly two places, and neither is in the four
  bodies the review read.** On the package path `ChangePlanner` computes `desired âˆ’ present` and
  asks `is_drifted` — one comparison covering `@quota`, `@size`, `@mount`, `@mount_options`,
  `@channel` and `@classic` across zfs, lvm, btrfs and snap. A converged declaration never reaches
  the trait. On the dependent path `Dependents::apply` asks `extras::in_effect` and skips anything
  in force. The read inside `ZfsInstallable::install` is a **local idempotence guard behind a
  decision made upstream**, not a fourth converge loop.
- **The rename is half a vocabulary.** Every value flowing through the trait is a `PackageSpec`,
  produced into a `Package`, recorded in `StateRegistry.packages`, serialized into
  `registry.json`. Renaming the verb at 159 sites while the nouns stay package-shaped leaves two
  vocabularies where there was one and buys no property the compiler can check. Renaming the
  nouns is a wire-format change to `registry.json` and `SavedPlan` — a compatibility decision, and
  the owner's, not a refactor's.

What made those four bodies *read* as orphan loops is that nothing said where the decision was
made. The trait says so now, which is where somebody reading one of the four will be.

**A gate shipped unable to fail, and a mutation caught it — the second time in two rulings.** The
phase-dispatch scan searched for `Phase::Execs =>` as a substring. Folding `Execs` into the ignored
or-pattern deletes the dispatch and still contains that substring, so the check passed over the
exact regression it existed for. That is F-2's family reproduced inside a check written for F-2's
family, and `Y12`'s gate did the same thing a day earlier by reporting a file clean it had not
read. Both were found by mutating the source and watching, not by review. **A gate is not a gate
until it has been watched to fail**, and both scans now carry their failure modes as controls.

**Behaviour a user could notice: two, both narrowings, both in `adapters/secret.toml`.** A
`[[secret]]` row may now name an `os` and is skipped elsewhere — a row that names none still
applies everywhere, so no existing file changes meaning. And a second `[[secret]]` block claiming
a name is now refused out loud instead of silently kept; the first still wins, which is what the
lookup already did, so the change is that it is said rather than that it is different.

Rules in II.1 and II.7; reasons in V.144, V.145 and V.146.

## Y14

**Status: ANSWERED — built 2026-08-06, ruled 2026-08-06.** The two behaviours filed for a
ruling were ruled in opposite directions, which is why they were filed separately: **item 1
stands** (a package that fails fails the command), and **item 2 is reversed** by `Y15` — a plan
naming a manager this machine does not have is skipped, not failed. The reason given for filing
item 2, *"the one case `sync` never meets, since a planner cannot schedule an absent backend"*,
**was wrong**, and `Y15` records what the code actually did instead. Raised by
`lamdan/whole-repo-2026-08-05.md` as **F-4**, ranked third on the accuracy axis. Accurate on the
site it names and wrong about the size of it: *"`apply` is **the one** change path `heal` cannot
recover"* — it was one of eight. The recommendation this implements is the review's own
(*"rebuild `SyncChanges` from the saved plan and hand it to `SyncEngine::sync`; the freeze
survives and the WAL comes with it"*), and nobody ruled it, so it is here to be confirmed or
reversed.

**Y14 — Does a command that installs or removes have to record it, or only the engine?**

`verbs/plan.rs` held zero references to `Transaction`, `journal` or `execute_with_telemetry`, and
`handle_apply` walked `installs` and then `removals` in two serial loops calling the backend
directly. So the `plan`/`apply` pair — the feature sold in `readme.md` as the reviewable,
frozen, Terraform-shaped change — was the one change path with no write-ahead log, and
`shall heal`, which reads the journal, could not recover an interrupted `shall apply` because
`apply` never wrote one.

**The scan that answered it found seven more files, and eleven call sites in the eight.**
`upgrade`, `remove-orphans` and `purge-undeclared`, the suspend removal in `packages.rs`, the
expired-lease sweep and the suspension restore in `leases.rs`, `run`'s auto-provision, the shell
restore, and the remediation install in `diagnostics.rs` all reached a package manager with
nothing recording that they had. **One of them is `purge-undeclared`**, which this repo's own prose calls the most destructive command in the
program. Nothing had ever decided that those paths did not need a record; the journal was
written for the transaction engine, so it lived in the transaction engine, and *what the engine
schedules is what gets journalled* became the rule by default. That is `F-2`'s mechanism — a
gate drawn around the artifact that was under review — for the ninth time.

**BUILT, part one: `apply` executes its frozen plan through `SyncEngine::sync`.** The freeze
survives because the engine does not plan: it takes a `SyncChanges` and runs it, and the graph
here is the one rebuilt from the plan file and trimmed by the review screen. What arrives with
it is the write-ahead log, the transaction, auto-rollback, the prior-state probe, the pre-sync
snapshot, `@health=`, the per-package hooks, the events, and one manager command per wave
instead of one per package — the ten-times cost `sync` stopped paying and `apply` did not. Two
hundred lines of scaffolding are gone with the loops, including the guard call `apply` was
making for itself: the engine's first act is `guard::enforce` over the same graph under the same
`GuardScope::Apply`, which is one call rather than two that can drift apart.

**BUILT, part two: every other package mutation carries its own record.** `journalled` is the
log without the ceremony — one entry per action, flushed before the mutation future is polled,
closed after. A whole transaction is the wrong shape for reclaiming an expired lease, and
demanding one would have been the reason to keep doing nothing. A record that cannot be written
aborts the mutation, which is what the engine already did to an unrecordable batch.

**BUILT, part three: the gate is drawn around the property.**
`tests/wal_enumeration_tests.rs` counts every package mutation in `src/` and requires each file
to name what makes an interruption recoverable — `Transaction`, `Journalled`, or `Recomputed`
under II.19's line. It is checked in both directions, a `Journalled` claim is checked against
the file that must contain the call, and the scan is fed the exact lines it exists to catch
before anything trusts it. It was written first and watched fail on all eight.

**A sibling found while building, and it is the same family one layer down.** Rebuilding the
graph from a saved plan called `add_node` in a loop and wired no edges, so a `@requires` a user
wrote survived into the plan file — it is in the specs' own `requires` — and was read back as
nothing. `rebuild` had it too, with a worse spelling: it keyed its install map by the bare name
while `requires` is written `backend:name`, so the lookup could never hit. Four hand-written
copies of "add the nodes, wire the edges" existed; two had edges. There is one now.

**Behaviour a user could notice, and it is the reason this is not filed as an implementation
detail:**

1. **`shall apply` now fails when a package fails.** It used to `warn!` and continue, then print
   `Applied plan: N installed, M removed` and exit 0 over a machine where half the plan had not
   happened. Through the engine a failed node fails the command, names the declaration it failed
   for, and rolls the transaction back. This is `sync`'s behaviour, and a frozen plan is one
   change to one machine — but it is a real change to what a script wrapping `shall apply` sees,
   and reversing it is a one-line `continue_on_error`.
2. ~~**A plan naming a backend this machine does not have now fails the command.**~~
   **Reversed by `Y15`, 2026-08-06.** It is skipped, reported, and the command succeeds. The
   argument written here for failing — *"the only case `sync` never meets, since the planner
   cannot schedule a backend that is not there"* — was false in both halves: the planner
   scheduled nothing because `spec_is_missing` raised `BackendNotFound` from inside the fan-out
   and **failed the whole `sync`**, so `sync` met this case first and worse. See `Y15`.
3. **`apply` now takes a pre-sync snapshot, runs the declared health checks, fires
   `before_sync`/`after_sync` and the `on_drift` event, and refuses on an unapproved hook
   (II.12).** More safety and more hooks firing than before; on Windows it also means the
   ~51-second restore point that `sync` takes and `apply` did not. It also honours
   `[remove] purge` / `--purge`, which the hand-written loop called `remove` regardless of.
4. **`apply` is faster**, by the same measure `Y1` ruled on: six packages went as six
   `apt install` processes and now go as one.
5. **`heal` can now recover an interrupted `apply`, `upgrade`, `remove-orphans`,
   `purge-undeclared`, lease sweep or shell restore** — which is the point, and means a crash
   during one of those is now followed by a recovery that was previously silent.

Rules in II.7 and II.19; reasons in V.147 and V.148.

## Y15

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled and built 2026-08-06.** Raised by the owner while reviewing `Y14`'s
two filed-for-ruling behaviours, and it took one question to find that the premise under the
second one was false.

**Y15 — Is a manager this machine does not have a broken config, or a portable one?**

**Portable.** *"I think for all these it should warn, but legitimately not fail. I think that
should be the rule, so that configs are super portable."* A line pinned to a manager this host
does not have is the half of the config that belongs to a different machine: it is skipped,
reported in `skipped` with the reason, and the command still succeeds.

**The question that found it.** `Y14` filed the absent-backend change for a ruling on the
grounds that it was *"the one case `sync` never meets, since a planner cannot schedule an absent
backend and a plan file can be carried between machines."* Asked why `sync` could not meet it if
the manager is named in the config file, the answer was that it could, and worse:
`ChangePlanner::spec_is_missing` turned `registry.get(&spec.backend) == None` into
`Error::BackendNotFound` inside the install fan-out, so the `?` carried it out of `plan()`
and **the whole sync failed having planned nothing** — twenty `winget:` lines dropped by one
`apt:` line beside them. `apply` was not the odd one out; it was the one that had been merciful.

**This is `Q9` clause 3 finishing its journey, not a new rule.** *"A real backend that cannot
run here is a different answer... it is a fact about the machine — so it says that and exits
0"*, ruled 2026-07-28 about a backend named in a command **argument**. `shall install brew:jq`
on a machine without brew has warned and exited 0 ever since, while `brew:jq` written in a
**file** failed the whole sync — one question with two answers in one program, because the
ruling was applied to the surface under review when it was made. Nothing was added to `install`
or `teleport` here: they were already right, and `Q9` is why.

**RULED, and the rule is in II.7c.** Absence is skipped; failure still fails; `--keep-going` is
the per-run opt-in for a caller that wants best-effort, with no file form. A name that is not a
backend at all remains a grammar error — skipping is for names Shall knows, and a config that
silently skipped its own typos would describe a machine nobody has.

**One predicate, because the first cut of this fixed half of it.** `apt` on Windows is absent
from the registry; `brew` on a Linux box without brew is registered and unavailable. Two facts
about Shall, one about the machine. `BackendRegistry::runs_here` answers it once, and the test
that pins the rule is written against a manager (`zypper`) that takes a *different* branch on
Windows than on Linux, so a fix for one branch cannot pass while the other stays broken.

**What it touched, and what it deliberately did not.** Skipping is applied at the planner (per
declaration, before anything is asked), at `apply` (per graph node, before the summary counts
it), and in `SyncEngine::sync` as the backstop every path shares — a graph can arrive from a
plan file another machine wrote or from this machine's journal. The silent siblings went with
it: `upgrade`, `remove-orphans`, `purge-undeclared` and the expired-lease sweep each walked past
an absent manager with a bare `continue` and reported the rest as the whole job. **`shall install
apt:jq` typed at a Windows prompt still errors** — that is not a config travelling between
machines, it is an instruction about this one.

**V.15 was checked and is untouched.** *"An explicit `snap:foo` failing when snap isn't listed is
a feature"* looked like a collision until `priority` turned out to be one shared file rather than
one per host: a portable setup lists every manager it uses anywhere, and each machine uses the
subset it has. V.15 governs what you declared; this rule governs what you have.

**Reasons in V.149. Rule in II.7c. `Y14` item 2 is reversed; `Y14` item 1 stands.**

---

## Y16

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled and built 2026-08-07.** Raised by the owner while reviewing three
subsystems an audit had proposed deleting. All three were kept, and the third turned out to be
broken in a way that reframed the whole question.

**Y16 — `shall repl`, the ratatui screens, and the Lua hook arm: delete, or keep?**

The case for deletion was cost. `shall repl` is a second entry point onto answers `eval | jq`
already gives; the two ratatui screens are 641 lines; and `mlua` vendors **28,687 lines of Lua
5.4 C source**, rebuilt from scratch on every clean build — ten times per CI push across four
release targets and six integration images — to serve one branch of one `if`, when `#rhai`
already provides in-process scripting and `rhai` is independently justified by `vars.shall`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-07): keep all three, and make them work.** *"Everything must work and it
not working is not cause for deletion but fixing."*

- **`shall repl` stays**, which `U34` had already ruled on 2026-07-26 (*"build it — if it is
  easy"*). Verified end to end rather than asserted: bare and prefixed names resolve, `when`
  evaluates against this host, `:vars`/`:eval` answer, EOF leaves. It is 148 lines over the one
  resolver and adds no dependency, which is the condition `U34` attached.
- **Both ratatui screens stay.** The audit's framing — "641 lines of TUI" — described neither.
  `preview.rs` is the confirmation screen `sync` and `plan apply` show on a real terminal, and
  deselecting a package there is the only way to say *"these four, not that one"* without
  editing a manifest; a y/n prompt cannot express it, so deleting it is a rewrite that loses a
  feature. `history.rs` is `shall history`, which the 2026-07-27 removal-cluster ruling already
  kept as the browsing half of an interface pair with `rollback <ref>`. **One real defect:** it
  had no terminal guard, so in a pipe or a cron job it entered raw mode and failed with an OS
  error rather than the sentence `sync` and `rollback` both print. Fixed, pointing at
  `shall git log` — the command that actually exists.
- **All three hook dialects stay** (as ruled 2026-07-20), **and the `#rhai` arm is fixed.** It
  had never run: the marker line was handed to the engine, `#` is reserved in Rhai, and every
  `#rhai` hook died with a syntax error on line 1. The one shipped example compounded it by
  calling `exec(...)`, which no engine here registers. **A dialect nothing tests is a dialect
  that does not run.** The marker is now stripped (blanked, so error line numbers still match),
  all three arms are handed the same four facts, and `#rhai` gets the same standard library
  `vars.shall` has, from the same builder — because II.6b defines that file's trust *as* a
  hook's, so a hook cannot have less.

**`mlua` stays too, and its cost stands as measured.** The vendored-C build time was not
disputed and is not the reason to keep it: Lua is the *fall-through* dialect, so every hook that
does not say otherwise is Lua, including the two in the shipped example config. Reversing that
is a user-visible change to configs that already exist, and the owner declined it. **Rule in
II.12, reasons in V.150.**

## Y17

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled and built 2026-08-07.** Raised out of `Y16`: fixing the `#rhai` arm
put a real binary in front of all three dialects, and the third one did not run on this platform
at all.

**Y17 — a `#!` hook is dead on Windows. Refuse it there, or make it work?**

Confirmed against the OS rather than reasoned: a script file handed to `CreateProcess` comes back
*"The specified executable is not a valid application for this OS platform."* A Unix kernel reads
the first line and launches what it names; **Windows has no such mechanism at any level**, so the
failure is not fixable inside the hook. What the user saw was `Polyglot execution failed: … (os
error 193)`, which reads as *your script is broken* for a script that is fine.

Three ways out were put to the owner:

1. **Refuse on Windows**, naming `#rhai` and Lua as the dialects that run everywhere. Honest, but
   it breaks the one-config-every-machine promise the product is for.
2. **Route it through PowerShell.** Rejected in the asking: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` would then
   run under PowerShell, which treats the line that chose Python as a comment. That does not run
   the script, it runs a different one.
3. **Read the shebang ourselves** — take the interpreter's name, find it on PATH, run
   `python3 <script>`.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-07): option 3, built robust.**

The measurement that made it cheap: **the `#!` line does not have to be stripped.** Every language
a shebang names treats it as a comment, so the file runs unmodified — the whole Windows arm is
"resolve a name, put the script last". What the ruling shipped:

- **The shebang is read on every platform, not just Windows**, in `model/script.rs` — the file
  whose stated job is this question and which had *three* callers using two different answers. An
  absolute interpreter that exists is used as written, so on Unix this launches the same binary
  the kernel would have. `/usr/bin/env` is dropped rather than launched, because the PATH search
  it stands for now happens here.
- **`python3` finds a Windows `python`.** A shebang says `python3` because that is what Unix calls
  it; a Windows install is almost always `python`, with `py` there when neither is. The fallback
  list is deliberately short — the same program under the name this OS gives it, never something
  similar.
- **A missing interpreter is named, with every spelling that was tried.** `#!/bin/bash` on a
  machine with no bash is still a refusal — it always will be — but it now says which program is
  missing instead of blaming the script.
- **Environment assignments in a shebang (`env -S FOO=1 python3`) are refused**, because one of
  the three callers runs through an executor with no per-command environment and a form honoured
  by two callers out of three is worse than one refused by all three.
- **`exec:` and Shall's own event hooks read the shebang too.** They shared the file and ignored
  the first line on both platforms — `sh <script>` does not consult a shebang either — so a
  `#!/usr/bin/env python3` event hook was already broken on Linux. One question, one answer, three
  callers.
- **A `vars.<ext>` provider was the fourth site, with the same bug inverted.** It picks its
  interpreter by extension (IX.6, not by shebang, and that stays), but it named literally `python`
  on Windows and literally `python3` everywhere else — so a Windows box with only `python3`, or a
  Linux box with only `python`, had a `vars.py` it could not run. The extension table is kept; the
  *name* it produces now goes through the same lookup, so the fallbacks and the alias-avoidance
  reach it. **Not** given shebang parsing: IX.6 says a provider needs no shebang, and a second
  dispatch there would be the disease, not the cure.

**Rule in II.12, reasons in V.150.**

## Y18

**Status: ANSWERED — raised 2026-08-07 by `LX-7`; three of the four ruled by the owner
2026-08-08, the fourth ruled and built 2026-08-09.** Raised by pointing `named_commands_exist_tests` at `docs/`
for the first time. `PART_II_LOOKS_WRONG` in that file is asserted exact and shrink-only, so a
ruling shrinks it and nothing can be quietly added; it is down to one entry.

**Y18 — Part II names three commands the program does not have. Which of them is the spec wrong
about, and which is the program?**

**Ruled 2026-08-08: the spec was wrong in every case where the code was checked.** Findings 1, 2
and 4 are corrected in Part II in the same change. Finding 3 stays open, and the reason it does
is the finding underneath it — see below.

The gate's rule for `docs/` is weaker than the one for `src/` and `readme.md`, and deliberately:
a record has to stay free to name a command on the day it was deleted. So the property is *a dead
command named in `docs/` is a command the spec says is dead*, with `target-state.md` II.17 read as
the register rather than restated. That reduced 62 raw hits to 10 and left these three.

1. **The sync nudge — RULED, spec corrected.** Prescribed as *"3 packages are now orphaned; run
   `shall clean`."* There is no `clean` verb; the live one is `remove-orphans`, and the rule now
   says so — including the bare `clean` in the sentence above it, which named the same absent
   verb without the prefix that made it visible to the gate. (`run=clean` is a schedule action,
   not a command — `model/schedule.rs:6` and `resolve.rs:1403` both carry it — and the rule now
   says that out loud so the next reader does not correct it.)
2. **The `adopt` output header — RULED, spec corrected.** Prescribed as *"`shall forget` is the
   way out."* `app/adopt.rs:498` already writes `shall unmanage <backend>:<name>`, and
   `adopt.rs:979` asserts it. **The code was right and the rule was stale**, which is the
   direction worth naming: the checked artifact held and the prose did not.
3. **II.17's register is incomplete — RULED 2026-08-09: make `@source=` work, and the row goes
   in.** II.16's own table records `shall shim jq --source cargo:jq` becoming the line
   `shim:jq@source=cargo:jq`, so the command was deleted; II.17 never gained the entry. It has
   one now, and `bugs.md`'s entry is closed rather than re-pointed.

   **The bug did not die with the command.** `source` was a legal option on a `shim:` line —
   `config/grammar/statement.rs:1477` lists it in `SHIM_OPTION_KEYS` and `:2690` asserts it
   parses — and no apply path read it: `app/apply/dependents.rs:73` called `create_shim(name)`
   and nothing else. Accepted, documented, discarded, in the new spelling. The ruling was
   therefore not *deletion or loss* but **what `@source=` should mean**, and the owner took the
   answer that keeps the feature: the shim provisions and runs the provider the line names.

   **Built. The record was never missing — only unread.** A shim is the shall binary under
   another name and has nowhere to keep data, which is why every sketch of this started by
   inventing a sidecar store. It does not need one: the config that declared the shim is the
   config the shim process loads on its way in, and it still says `source=cargo:jq`.
   `Runner::shim_spec` reads it there (`app/run.rs`), so there is no second store to disagree
   with the first. Absent, the bare name resolves through `priority` exactly as before — every
   existing `shim:` line behaves identically.

   **And the mechanism it belongs to had never run.** `exec_shim` had no test caller anywhere in
   the tree, and `Runner::run` spawned the shim's own name through `PATH` without excluding
   `bin_dir` — the directory the shim was deployed into, ahead of the real binary, on purpose.
   Read end to end there was nothing between the two: no depth counter, no marker, no exclusion.
   The runner now resolves every name it spawns through `PATH` **skipping any file that is this
   binary under another name** — by identity, never by directory, because `web:`, `github:` and
   `appimage:` deploy real executables into that same `bin_dir` and excluding it would hide
   them. `tests::a_shim_on_path_is_never_what_the_runner_spawns` was watched failing on the old
   resolution, returning the shim. Reasons in `why.md`, under `V.152`.
   **And a fifth finding, produced by writing the ruling down.** Correcting finding 1 meant
   writing the sentence *"`shall clean`, where the verb is `remove-orphans`"* into four
   documents, and the gate reddened on all four: `clean` is a deleted command II.17 never
   recorded, exactly as `shim` is. It is entered now — split into `remove-orphans` and
   `clean-cache` (V.36) — because nothing hangs on it the way `@source=` hangs on `shim`. **The
   register being incomplete is not a documentation problem; it is what makes a correction
   unwritable.**
4. **The rule about the gate's own scope — RULED, spec corrected.** `target-state.md` read
   ***"`docs/` is out of scope, deliberately"*** while the gate was scanning `docs/`, so the
   canonical spec and the test disagreed about the scope of the same gate. The record argument is
   kept and is now stated as the reason for the weaker property rather than for an exemption:
   *`docs/` is checked against the Deleted register, not against the live surface.* Reasons in
   `why.md`, under `F-2`.

**What shipped in the same change, because none of it needed a ruling:**

- **`bugs.md`'s F4 justification was re-pointed.** A **CLOSED** owner ruling (2026-07-26, do not
  wire `--help` to the registry) rested on *"`doctor` already carries the live count"*. `S38`
  folded `doctor` into `check <section>`; the code was swept and the ruling was not, because
  nothing read `docs/`. The live count is `verbs/check.rs:1012` — `check health`. **The ruling
  stands**: its second reason, that help must not read config from disk, never depended on the
  first. Only the false clause moved.
- **`why.md:708`** paraphrased a test's name with the binary at command position, where the repo's
  convention is that prose spells the product `Shall`. It now reads *"the shall binary survives an
  uninstall attempt"* — the same fact, one word further from the start of a command. (This bullet
  was itself caught by the gate on the run that wrote it, which is the shortest proof available
  that the scan reaches `docs/`.)
- **`docs/archive/` stays out of scope.** Its own README says *"Nothing here is current"*, and a
  register of what was deleted owes no account of a directory that has already said it is stale.

**Why this is a gate and not a sweep.** `F-2` built `named_commands_exist_tests` around the
property rather than the artifact and then drew the roots around `src/`-and-friends, which is the
same mistake one level up: the gate was drawn around the code that was under review. The six
defects in its header were shipped product; these three are shipped specification, and the
mechanism that hid them was identical — one fact, several copies, a gate around one copy.

## Y19

**Status: ANSWERED — built 2026-08-07 from `LX-1`, ruled 2026-08-10.** Not a new rule: Part II
already made this ruling for one field and the parser layer had no type to express it with.
Recorded here because the *visible* behaviour changed — a manager whose output a parser cannot
read now stops the read instead of reporting an empty machine — and a user could notice that.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): yes, keep it.** A hard failure where there used to be a clean-looking
empty result is the right trade, and the asymmetry below is the whole argument: a manager that
fails is safe, and a manager that succeeds with a changed format silently reports the whole
machine as drifted and adopts nothing. The louder answer is the correct one.

**Y19 — `parse_installed` could not say "I read four hundred bytes and recognised nothing".**

`4d4a890` (2026-08-05) diagnosed the whole chain and fixed four links of it:

> *"Through Shall that became `Ok("")` â†’ **a parser finding nothing** â†’ `list_installed`
> answering `Ok(vec![])`. Nothing in the chain believed anything had failed."*

`run_output`, `info`, `list` and `hook-reconcile` were fixed. **The parser — the link the commit
named itself — was not**, because the fix needed a type change and nothing recorded that it had
been skipped. Eighty-one parser functions, and not one could express the difference between
*this machine has no packages* and *I did not understand this*.

**The consequence is asymmetric, and the wrong branch is the likely one.** A manager that
*fails* raises, the backend drops out of `installed_sets`, `is_installed` answers true and
removals stay scheduled — safe. A manager that *succeeds with a changed format* returns
present-and-empty: every declaration is planned as a fresh install, every drift removal is
dropped, `check drift` reports the whole machine as drifted, `adopt` adopts nothing, exit 0.
Format drift is precisely the failure mode of the backends nobody has run.

**Part II already ruled this**, at `target-state.md:71`, about `machine_list_parser`:

> ***"Absent means *this backend cannot answer that*, never *the answer is none*"***

and again at `:1979`: *"an unsupported flag fails with a usage message, which every reader here
hands back as an empty result — so assuming it would report an empty machine to exactly the users
on older tooling, which is `Q40` under a new name."* Both sentences are about this. Neither could
be enforced, because below them sat a signature with no way to say it.

**What shipped:** `parse_installed` returns `Result<Vec<Package>, Unrecognised>`; `Unrecognised`
carries the manager, the count of lines nobody read, and the first of them, so a report becomes a
fixture instead of a request to reproduce. It crosses into `Error::Unreadable`, classified
`Permanent` — a manager prints the same bytes next time.

**The judgement is made once**, in `or_unrecognised`: found nothing out of lines that carried
something is the failure; found nothing out of nothing is an empty machine. Two parsers overrode
it with their own, and both were required to: `asdf_list`, where a plugin added with no version
installed is a real state that produces no packages out of two data lines, and `pixi_list`, which
has no unread case at all because every unindented line resolves to a package, its own banner, or
noise it names — its failure mode is junk, and there are fixtures for that.

**The family, swept.** `MachineListing.parse` (the *more* exposed path, since it is a negotiated
flag on a tool whose version Shall does not control), `ParserSpec` in the onboarder — where all
four arms had a way of spelling it, and the sharpest was a user's regex failing to compile into a
warning nobody reads and a bare machine — `slice_fixed_table`, where a missing header row was the
same answer as an empty table, and both `_ => vec![]` dispatch arms, which answered *the machine
is empty* for any backend name at all. `parse_search` is deliberately **not** fallible, and that
asymmetry is asserted rather than left to be rediscovered: a search returning nothing is a fact
the user asked for and can see; an installed listing returning nothing is a fact the planner acts
on unseen.

`registry.rs`'s `installed_fn: |_| vec![]` for `stack` — a manager with no listing verb — is now
`CannotList("stack")`. It is inert, because such a manager gets no `Queryable`. It is written down
because the next one will be added by someone reading that row.

**Fixtures, captured rather than typed.** apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, apk and `apt-mark showmanual`
now have their *installed* listings from real containers; before this they had captured
`outdated` output and nothing for the listing the planner acts on. `zypper`'s carries 52 lines of
repository refresh and an expired-key warning before its table, because that is what it prints on
a cold image. The instrument's self-test is the finding made concrete: `bsd::parse_pkg` fed apt's
listing reads 7 of 92 lines, **every one of them wrong** — `libbz2-1.0` becomes `libbz2` at
version `1.0` — silently, confidently, and naming packages that cannot be removed because they do
not exist. That is what `ecosystem.rs:633`'s rule is about, and no return type catches it.

**Not addressed, and asserted so it cannot be mistaken for addressed:** junk. `apt::parse_list`
reads apt's own `E: Could not open lock file` as a package named `E:` at that version. It is a
different failure from emptiness — a wrong package rather than a missing one — and no return type
distinguishes them. `junk_is_a_different_failure_from_emptiness_and_this_change_does_not_address_it`
pins it.

## Y20

**Status: ANSWERED — built 2026-08-07 from `LX-2`, the question inside it ruled by the owner
2026-08-09.**

**Y20 — every path that removes now carries proof it asked, and closing an undeclared port is one
of them. Should it count against `max_removals`?**

`readme.md:358` promises that *every path that removes anything goes through one guard*, and the
next sentence says the promise is checked by `removal_guard_enumeration_tests.rs` — *"it was
written because the sentence was false for the whole resource family until 2026-07-28."* The
check implemented it as `is_removal_call`, a predicate matching `.remove(`/`.purge(` with `sudo`
on the line, plus `.remove_repo(`, `.remove_shim(` and `.deprovision(`.

**`apply/firewall.rs` closes every open port no `firewall:` line declares, using `deny_command`.
It matches none of them.** The word `guard` appeared nowhere in that file — not an import, not a
call, not a comment — and the file had zero tests. `max_removals` did not count those closures,
`protected` could not name them, `--allow-mass-removal` was not consulted, and `enforce_extras` —
which exists *precisely* because the extras teardown runs outside the transaction — was not
called.

**The fix for `G-1` replaced a stale list of paths with a stale list of verbs.** The staleness
moved into a predicate, where nobody re-derives it, because it had a passing self-test — and that
self-test fed it four lines already in the ledger, so it proved the scanner could see what it
already knew about.

**What shipped: `Reaped`.** A token with a private field, mintable only by `guard::enforce`,
`enforce_extras` and `enforce_deliberate`, required by every effector that removes —
`Installable::remove`, `Installable::purge`, `RepoManager::remove_repo`,
`ShimManager::remove_shim`, `SchedulerManager::deprovision`, and the firewall's `close_port`,
which is split out of `run_firewall` so that the one call in that file which takes something away
is a different function from the ones that do not. **The compiler enumerates the removal paths
now**, and effector six is covered by construction rather than by someone remembering the list.
This is what `PlanScope` did for planning, applied to removal.

**Two things are honest about the shape rather than papered over.** `deny_command` returns argv
rather than performing the removal, so the token sits on the call that runs it — not perfectly
uniform with the other five. And the executor's check is a *runtime* refusal: a graph carrying a
removal that reaches `Transaction` without a token refuses rather than failing to compile, because
making that a compile error means typing the graph by whether it contains a removal, which is a
larger change than this finding earns. The five effectors **are** compile-enforced; that seam is
what hands them their token.

**`Reaped::for_reason` is the ledger of what does not ask**, named and greppable, and it has
exactly two kinds of entry: a unit test of an effector, and `heal`, which enforces each
interrupted removal individually *before* it becomes a graph node. `grep -rn "Reaped::for_reason"`
is the list a reviewer wants, and it is the list `is_removal_call` could never produce.

**THE QUESTION INSIDE IT, now answered.** *Is closing an undeclared port a removal for the
purposes of `max_removals`?* It was raised because the guard counted them, which is the
conservative reading and the one that follows from wiring `enforce_extras`, and it had a cost a
user would meet immediately: **a machine with 40 ports open and one `firewall:22/tcp` line hits
the default ceiling of 20 and refuses.**

**RULED 2026-08-09 (owner): yes, it is a removal and yes, it counts — against its own ceiling.**

The reading that lost was "one number for everything", which is what `Q7` clause 2 said and what
the code did. The owner's words: *"I think we should have different counts: counts of removed
packages that won't count them, and counts of changes."*

What is binding:

1. **`max_removals` is packages only**, default 20. Software leaving the machine.
2. **`max_extra_removals` is new**, default 20, and covers every resource teardown —
   `link:`, `service:`, `setting:`, `shim:`, `schedule:`, `repo:` — plus a port closed because
   no `firewall:` line declares it. A `dotfiles:` tree's files are `link:` lines and go here too.
   *(Amended 2026-08-10 by `N8`: ports leave this budget for `max_port_closures`, and a
   `max_total_changes` sits over every ceiling here. The rest of this clause stands.)*
3. **Both are budgets for the whole command, not for a phase.** A sync tears extras down in two
   places (the firewall, then the ledger's drift) and both spend the same `max_extra_removals`.
4. **Neither spends the other's budget.** That is the whole point of splitting them: one number
   made the stricter of the two govern both, so a server whose first `firewall:` declaration
   closes forty ports could not also remove a package.
5. **`--allow-mass-removal` answers both**, because "yes, that many, I meant it" is one question.
   Protection is still a refusal and nothing overrides it (V.26).
6. **The refusal names which ceiling it hit**, so the reader is sent to the line they have to
   change rather than to the other one.

The cost this ruling accepts, stated plainly: **a machine with forty ports open and one
`firewall:22/tcp` line still refuses on its first sync**, now at `max_extra_removals` rather than
at `max_removals` (and at `max_port_closures` since `N8`). Forty ports closing at once is the shape a ceiling exists to interrupt, and
the answer is one flag.

The mechanism is in `S55`; the rule is in **II.28**; the reason is in **V.159**.

## Y21

**Status: ANSWERED — raised 2026-08-07 by `LX-6`, ruled by the owner 2026-08-08.**

**Y21 — 2.5 MB of specification was written under documentation economics and is read under
context economics. Does the corpus get cut, and if so where?**

**Ruled: cut it. Distil the record into a short list of lessons and put that where an agent will
not read it.**

What went, and it is all recoverable from git by SHA: `docs/archive/` (twelve grade rounds,
readiness reviews and session logs, whose own README said nothing inside it was current),
`docs/spec/proposals/` (six designs, every one of them ruled and folded into Part II),
`docs/spec/history.md` (8,390 lines organised by *session*, a unit no maintainer has), and
`docs/INEFFICIENCIES.md` (an audit whose every finding was already marked fixed, fixed-by, or
not-done-with-the-reason). **17,900 lines, about 1.4 MB.**

What stayed, and why each: `target-state.md` is the rule, `why.md` is the reason `CLAUDE.md`
makes mandatory reading before changing a rule, `decisions.md` is the ruling — *an event outside
the tree, with a person and a date on it* — and that is the one artifact git cannot reconstruct,
so it is kept at full fidelity rather than compressed to a status line. `plan.md`, `bugs.md`,
`principles.md`, `readme.md` and `SPEC.md` are the map and the trackers. `BUILDER.md` and
`GRADER.md` stayed where they are: they are briefs a person still hands to an agent, which makes
them tools rather than records, and the cut was about records.

**`docs/attic/lessons.md` is the distillate** — thirty-one things, each one the residue of at
least one shipped defect, under a header telling agents not to read it. That header is the point
of the ruling and not a joke: the lessons are for a person, once. An agent that reads them is
paying the context cost the cut exists to stop, for advice that is already enforced by the gates
in `tests/`.

**The one thing this loses, said plainly.** The grade rounds were where a builder was handed
"the newest `GRADE-*.md`" as a brief. That handoff needs a new source; the findings themselves
are all in `bugs.md` and the register, which is where the disposition discipline had already put
them.

**The 53 unattached `why.md` entries** — the third part of the question — are not retired here.
`why_entries_are_attached_to_something_tests.rs` ratchets the count down and every citation
resolves; attaching the remainder is work, not a ruling.

429,405 words across `docs/`. ~570k tokens — more than half a 1M context before a line of the
119,388 lines of Rust. And it is written *for an agent*: `BUILDER.md:1` is `# YOU ARE THE BUILDER`,
and `history.md`'s organising unit is the **Session** (94 headings against 36 commit dates). A
human maintainer does not have sessions. A context window does.

**The economics genuinely differ.** Documentation is written once and read forever, so its cost is
bounded by the writer. Context is re-paid on every read, by every agent, forever. Nobody did that
multiplication, and the finding is right that nobody did.

**The evidence is inside the corpus and is not an opinion.** `SPEC.md`'s readiness paragraph said
macOS *"has never been run"* and its job *"has not yet gone green"* for **eleven days and 228
commits** after `history.md` recorded the green run — four lines under a sentence about exactly
that failure. The `62` beside it was right the whole time, because a test asserts it. *Where this
corpus is checked it is true, and where it is prose it is not.* (That paragraph is corrected as of
this entry; the pattern it demonstrates is what `Y21` is about.)

**What was built rather than proposed**, because it needs no ruling and deletes nothing:

- `tests/why_entries_are_attached_to_something_tests.rs`. `CLAUDE.md` makes reading a rule's
  `why.md` entry **mandatory** before changing the rule, and 53 of 155 entries were cited by no
  Part II rule and quoted by no test — a third of a mandatory gate explaining nothing. The gate
  asserts every citation resolves (zero failures, both directions) and ratchets the unattached
  count down from 53.
- `named_commands_exist_tests` now scans `docs/` (`Y18`), which is the other half of the same
  problem: 2,538 KB of spec that no gate had ever read.

**What is the owner's, and is not built:** the cut itself. `LX-6` proposes four files and ~5,200
lines — `readme.md`, `target-state.md`, `principles.md` unchanged, `decisions.md` rewritten to
status + ruling + date + who ruled, `archive/` and `proposals/` deleted, `BUILDER.md`/`GRADER.md`
moved to `.claude/agents/`. Its argument that nothing is lost is that 98% of `history.md`'s
content-word tokens already appear in commit messages, and that the one artifact git cannot
reconstruct — **a ruling, an event outside the tree with a person's name and a date on it** — is
exactly the file the cut keeps at full fidelity.

**That argument is strong and it is still not the builder's to act on.** It deletes the reasoning
this project has accumulated, and the standing ruling on this repo is that no capability is lost;
whether *reasoning* is a capability is the question, and it is a question about what the owner
wants this repository to be. A builder who answers it by deleting has answered it permanently.

**What an answer has to say:** whether the cut happens; if so, whether `history.md` goes entirely
or is thinned to the entries whose commit message does not already carry them; and where the 53
unattached `why.md` entries land — cited from the rule they explain, moved into the doc comment of
the test that enforces them, or retired.

## Y22

**Status: ANSWERED — raised 2026-08-07 by `LX-4`, ruled by the owner 2026-08-08.**

**Y22 — `flatpak`'s scope is a boolean where the data path needs a value. Rename the key?**

**Ruled: answer 1, and there are no legacy users to migrate.** `[backend_settings.flatpak]` takes
`scope = "user" | "system"`, defaulting to `system`, which is what flatpak itself does with
neither flag. `user` is deleted, and **refused by name** — a config that still sets it gets a
message naming `scope` rather than an install that silently goes machine-wide. That refusal is
not a compatibility shim: it reads the key in order to reject it, and never to honour it.

The scope is parsed once, at registration, into the existing `model::scope::Scope` — the same
type and the same vocabulary as `@scope=` on `setting:`, `link:` and `shim:` (V.69), so there is
one answer to "what does `user` mean" rather than a second one living in a backend. A value
neither word is refused rather than defaulted, because falling back to `system` on a typo is the
one outcome that installs for every account under a line asking for the opposite. Two call sites
used to read the raw map and compare it to `"true"` separately — `scope_args` and `needs_root` —
which is two chances to disagree about a string; there is now one field of type `Scope`.

**This does not by itself convert flatpak, and the exemption stays.** What remains is `@channel`:
`install_ref` builds the flatpak ref `name//channel`, and `ManagerConfig` has `VersionPin` for
`@version` and no equivalent for `@channel`. The shape is identical — a `ChannelPin` with the
same `Inline` / flag split would carry both flatpak's `name//branch` and snap's `--channel=`, and
`get_dependencies`' `runtime=` read already fits `DependsProbe`'s `NameReader`. **The exemption's
"optional remote" half was checked and is not a blocker**: no path in `flatpak.rs` passes a
remote to `install`, so nothing in the code needs the name slot to hold one.

The three answers as they were put, kept because the second one is the trap:

`ManagerConfig` rows can now carry `{setting.KEY|DEFAULT}`, substituted at registration from
`[backend_settings.<backend>]` — which is what took `conda` from 319 lines of hand-written Rust to
a row, argv byte-identical. `flatpak` was exempted for the same reason and is the next one, except
for the spelling.

It writes scope as **`user = "true"`**, a boolean (`examples/preferences.toml:171`). A row needs a
value it can substitute: `--{setting.scope|system}` where `scope` is `system` or `user`. A boolean
cannot be written into a flag name without the placeholder growing a conditional form, and a
template language in argv rows is how a data path stops being data.

1. **`scope = "user" | "system"`, and `user` stops being read.** â† taken. NO-LEGACY says the old
   key goes in the same change, and the silent-drift risk that would create is answered by
   refusing the old key by name.
2. **Keep `user`, give the placeholder a conditional form.** Cheap today, and it is the first line
   of a template language nobody designed.
3. **Leave flatpak hand-written.** Still true for now, for the `@channel` reason above — but that
   is a mechanism to build, not a property of flatpak.

The exemption in `backend_is_data_not_code_tests.rs` names `Y22` so the entry and the gate cannot
drift apart; it now names `@channel` as the one blocker left.

## Y23

**Status: ANSWERED — raised and ruled 2026-08-09, built in the same change.**

**Y23 — flatpak's channel drift is invisible, and the backend it would drift on has no switch.**

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-09): make it visible and make the repair real.** Read the branch, treat a
changed `@channel` as drift like D13 says, and repair it with what flatpak actually offers —
install the declared ref, then `make-current` — leaving any other installed branch alone. **Built
in the same change.**

**The finding.** `@channel` on flatpak is not decoration: `install_ref` builds the ref
`org.gimp.GIMP//beta` and the branch reaches the machine. But `fetch_installed` asked for
`--columns=application,version`, so the installed branch was never read; D13's drift check acts
only where the current value is readable, and for flatpak there was nothing to read. A channel
edit therefore applied once, at first install, and did nothing for ever after. Both halves were
silent, and the honoured-once half is what made it look finished.

**Why this needed a ruling and not a column.** D13 was ruled and built against snap, which has
`snap refresh --channel=`. flatpak has no switch at all — branches install side by side and the
launcher keeps running the one it ran yesterday. Adding the column alone would have routed the
drift into `flatpak install`, which **calls an already-installed ref an error and exits
non-zero** (`Error: %s%s%s already installed`, in the shipped binary). A channel that did nothing
would have become a sync that failed on every run.

**Measured, in a `debian:12` container against flathub (flatpak 1.14.10), not inferred:**

- `--columns=help` lists `branch` and `options`; **no column reports which branch is current**,
  and the binary carries no such word among its option strings.
- The listing is TAB-separated; a **trailing** empty column is dropped and a **middle** one is
  kept as an empty field. `application,version,branch` on a versionless app is
  `ai.jan.Jan\t\tstable`, which a whitespace split reads as version `stable` and no branch. This
  is why the parser is flatpak's own rather than the shared `parse_simple_list`.
- `flatpak install --or-update` is real: *"Update install if already installed."*
- `flatpak make-current APP BRANCH` is real and takes the same `--user` / `--system` scope flags.

**What shipped.** `--columns=application,version,branch` behind one reader used by both the query
and install paths; `--or-update` on **every** flatpak install, not only the channel path, because
an adopted package or a half-applied plan reaches that command holding a ref the machine already
has; `make-current` after an install that added a branch to an app that was on a different one;
and an app on **two** branches reports no channel at all, so D13's leave-an-unreadable-value-alone
rule takes it from there rather than a guess switching the machine on every sync for ever.

**What was deliberately not done.** The old branch is not uninstalled. Removing it is a removal,
it belongs to the guard and to a declaration that asked for it, and a channel edit did not ask.

Rules in II.2, reasons in `why.md` under `V.151`. `capability::HAS_CHANNELS` is
`["snap", "flatpak"]` and both report their channel now, so the family is closed by enumeration.


## Q53

**Status: ANSWERED — raised and ruled 2026-08-10. `S85` is the bug; this was the choice.**

**The question in plain words.** Shall lets a line pin a version (`brew:tokei@version=14.0.0`),
and `shall lock` writes those pins by itself from what it finds installed. Most package managers
can install an exact version. Several cannot. Shall has never decided what it owes the user in
that second case, so it does two different wrong things depending on which manager it is.

**What actually happens today, measured on the macOS nightly leg.** A sync installs `brew:tokei`.
`lock` records `14.0.0` — correctly; that is tokei's version. Every later sync reads it back as
`@version=14.0.0`, `brew.rs` builds `tokei@14.0.0`, and brew answers *No available formula with
the name "tokei@14.0.0"*. The sync dies, and it dies for ever, on a pin the user never typed.
Homebrew's `name@version` is a **different formula's name**, not a version selector: versioned
formulae exist for a handful of packages and carry a series (`python@3.12`, `openssl@3`), never a
full semver.

On fourteen other backends the same declaration is dropped and the install reports success at
whatever version the manager picked. Ten of those cannot do otherwise — `pacman`, `yay`, `paru`,
`scoop`, `mas`, `macports`, `krew`, `slackpkg`, `eopkg`, `emerge` have no mechanism to ask for a
version. **Four could and simply were not built**: `xbps`, `pkgin`, `pkg` and `pkg_add` all take a
`name-version` operand. That second group is the lie class: a command that did not do what it was
asked and said nothing.

**The chiluk that makes this tractable.** A lockfile has two jobs, and they are not the same job:

1. **Reproduce** — put this exact version back on another machine.
2. **Detect drift** — notice that this machine has moved off what was recorded.

Job 2 works on every manager, because it only needs to *read* a version. Job 1 needs the manager
to *accept* one. Conflating them is precisely what killed the macOS run: a record kept for job 2
was fed back as an install argument for job 1.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-10): all three parts, as recommended.** Rule in **II.53**, reason in
**V.183**.

- **Record the version everywhere, replay it only where it can be replayed.** The lockfile keeps
  what it observes on every manager, and drift reporting keeps working; a version is turned into
  an install argument only for a manager that can accept one. Nothing is removed and nothing is
  refused.
- **A hand-written pin that cannot be honoured is refused at plan time, by name, before anything
  runs** — not dropped, not attempted. `shall sync` says *"`pkgin` cannot install an exact
  version, so `jq@version=1.2.3` cannot be met — …"*, skips that package and continues; under
  `--locked` the same fact is fatal, because a run whose whole purpose is to reproduce a machine
  must not report success over a package it resolved freely. A pin the user typed is a decision;
  silently installing something else is the one outcome that is worse than either honouring it
  or refusing it.
- **`brew` stops hand-rolling a pin syntax it does not have.** It joined the cannot-pin list:
  Homebrew publishes versioned formulae only as a *series* (`python@3.12`), never as a full
  semver, so there was no honest version of "use a versioned formula when one exists" to build.

**What the ruling is built out of.** The provenance question — did a person type this pin, or did
`lock` record it? — needed no flag in the end, and that is the part worth keeping. `apply_locks`
stops injecting a recorded version into a spec whose backend cannot replay one, so **a version
that survives to the planner on such a backend can only have come from a line somebody wrote.**
The refusal is correct by construction rather than by a field that could be set wrong.

`Installable::pins_version` answers *whether*, defaulting to `false` — a new backend that says
nothing refuses a pin it might have honoured, which is a message, where the other default installs
the wrong version and reports success, which is not. `capability::CANNOT_PIN_VERSION` answers
*why*, and the refusal quotes it. The two are checked against each other rather than derived from
one another, so a backend that starts pinning and leaves its row behind is caught from both sides.

**Three things it turned up on the way**, all of them the same shape as the bug:

- **The exemption ledger did not cover the hand-written backends at all.** It scanned
  `registry.rs`'s registrars and `builtin_backends.toml`'s rows — and `brew` is neither, so the
  gate named *"every backend pins a version or says why"* was structurally blind to the one
  backend that did not merely drop a pin but invented one. Eleven more sat in the same blind spot.
- **`xbps` moved to the permanent side rather than being built.** `xbps-install name-1.2.3_1`
  needs the package's *revision* suffix, which `@version=` does not carry, so `name-1.2.3` names
  a package that does not exist — building a name and hoping, which is exactly what `brew` was
  doing. `pkgin`, `pkg` and `pkg_add` take a plain `name-version` and were built; the unbuilt
  ceiling went from four to **zero**.
- **A recorded version on a cannot-pin manager is still worth writing**, and `shall lock --list`
  now says which entries those are. The file's shape did not change: a record other tools read is
  not the place to put a sentence only a person needs.

**What is owed either way, and needs no ruling:** a reasoned exemption ledger over `version_pin`,
so a backend can be unable to pin but cannot be *silently* unable to pin, and so the four that
could pin and simply were not built (`helm`, and the `name-version` forms of `pkgin`, `pkg`,
`pkg_add`, `xbps`) are visible as a ratchet rather than invisible as a default. The registry walk
cannot be the instrument — registration is `cfg!(target_os)`-shaped, which is exactly how `dnf`
went unaudited in `S83`.

## Q54

**Status: ANSWERED — raised and ruled 2026-08-11. `S87` is the bug; this was the choice.**

**The question in plain words.** `shall uninstall xbps:pv` deleted the declaration, ran a sync,
printed `already up to date`, exited 0 — and left `pv` on PATH. It was not a special case: it is
what `uninstall` does whenever Shall has no ownership record for the package it names.

**Why the command can do nothing and still report success.** `uninstall` is not a separate
removal path. It deletes the line and lets the ordinary sync take the package away as *drift*,
which is V.34's whole point — one converge, not a second engine with the install half amputated.
But drift is defined as *a package Shall manages that nothing declares any more*. A package on
the machine that Shall does not manage is not drift; it is the user's own software, and leaving
it alone is correct. So when the ownership record is missing the plan is empty, and an empty plan
is `already up to date`.

`absent:` is the one thing Shall removes without owning (II.2, V.7) — "because you named it".
`uninstall` names it just as plainly and did not get the same treatment.

**How the ownership record goes missing.** `S87`: the registry is written once at the end of a
run, so a run killed before that leaves the package installed and owned by nobody. That is the
bug, and II.56's first half fixes it. This question is about the second half — what the command
should say in every case where the ownership record is genuinely absent, including the ones no
repair can reach (a package undeclared by hand before the uninstall, a package the user told
Shall to forget).

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-11), in the owner's words: "it should say it did not remove it and does
not own it."** Rule in **II.56**, reason in **V.186**.

- The command **fails** rather than warning. The failure this closes is precisely that a script
  could not see it — `shall uninstall x && rm -rf ~/.config/x` proceeded over a package that was
  still installed. A sentence on stderr under exit 0 is the same bug with more text.
- It names the package, says Shall has no record of installing it, and names `adopt` as the way
  to take ownership — or the manager, for a user who wants it gone without Shall involved.
- The preview says the same thing, or the two halves of one command describe different machines.
- **Asked only of names the registry did not carry when the command started**, so an ordinary
  uninstall — the overwhelming majority — asks no manager anything. A bare name that any manager
  already owns is settled from the registry alone, because `uninstall jq` means *the jq I have*.

**The half left open, and its ruling.** Whether `uninstall` should remove a package Shall does not
own, the way `absent:` does. Raised unruled because it is a decision about blast radius rather
than about honesty: it turns `uninstall` into a verb that can take away software Shall never
installed.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-11): behind a flag, and the flag writes an `absent:` line.**
`shall uninstall PKG --absent` undeclares the package, declares it `absent:`, and lets the
ordinary converge remove it — no ownership consulted, because `absent:` is already the one
declaration that reaches outside what Shall manages (II.2, V.7). Default `uninstall` is
unchanged: it still fails, and now names `--absent` alongside `adopt` as the two ways past it.

Settled with it, as implementation rather than rule:

- **`--absent` conflicts with `--temp`.** One says bring it back, the other says keep it gone.
- **A bare name resolves to the manager that holds it**, by listing — not the way `install`
  resolves a bare name, which answers *who could supply this* and would write a permanent line
  naming a manager that never had the package. Every holder is named, because `uninstall jq`
  means the jq I have. A bare name no manager holds is refused, not guessed at.
- **The declaration is dropped as well as added.** A package both declared and declared absent
  is a config that argues with itself on every sync.
- **The `S87` rule holds on this path too**: a survivor after the sync is reported, not reported
  as success. The message differs, because a package that survived an `absent:` line is a failed
  removal rather than a refused one, and "run `adopt`" is the wrong answer to it.
- **No inactive-module warning**, unlike a plain uninstall: that warning exists because a line in
  a module you forgot brings the package back, and an `absent:` line beats the module that wants
  it (II.7 rule 6).

## Q55

**Status: ANSWERED — raised and ruled 2026-08-11, on the back of `Q54`.**

**The question in plain words.** The `S87` repair rebuilt the lost ownership record by replaying
the write-ahead log, which records every install per operation. Should it read the **manifest**
instead — is a package this machine declares and already has Shall's, whether or not Shall put
it there?

**Why it was raised rather than built.** Reading the manifest looked like a strictly simpler
version of the same repair, and it is not. It loses one case and gains another, and the gained
one is the one with teeth:

- **Lost:** a package undeclared by hand and *then* uninstalled has no declaration left to prove
  it was ever managed, so nothing can recognise it.
- **Gained:** a package installed by hand and declared afterwards becomes Shall's. Nothing
  registers those today — an already-present package schedules no install, so `state.add` never
  runs — which is exactly why `adopt` exists. Under a manifest-derived repair, the day that
  declaration moves or goes, Shall removes software it never installed.

That second one is the blast-radius axis `Q54` had just put behind an explicit flag, and this
would have granted it by default and invisibly.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-11): yes — declaring a package you already had makes it Shall's.**
Rule in **II.56**, reasoning in **V.186**.

- Ownership is read from the resolved declaration set, not the log. There is no expiry: the
  seven-day log purge stops being a bound on anything.
- **The repair announces what it claimed.** Taking ownership is what makes a package removable
  when its declaration goes, so a machine that adopted software quietly would be deciding
  something on the user's behalf without saying so.
- **Declared is the whole of it.** An undeclared package on the machine is never claimed,
  however it got there. An installed set is not a manifest.
- Only `present` declarations count — an `absent:` line says the package must not be here.
- The lost case is covered by `Q54`'s `--absent`, which removes regardless of ownership.
- `completed_installs` and `unmanage`'s log-clearing were **deleted**, not left beside the new
  reader. `unmanage` drops the manifest line, which is now the whole of the forgetting.

## G1

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B1.**

**Does `--keep-going` change the exit code?** It did. Without the flag a failed sync exits 1;
with it, the identical failure exited **0** under `Status: SUCCESS`, and `--keep-going --quiet`
printed zero bytes over a run where every package failed. The flag's own help calls it "the
per-run opt-in for a fleet rollout that would rather take what it can get", and a fleet rollout
is exactly where the exit code is the only thing anybody reads.

**BUILT: no. "Continue past a failure" is not "report success".** A partial run persists what
succeeded, prints its summary and fires its hooks — all of that is real and must survive — and
*then* exits non-zero naming what did not. The three defects underneath it went with it:
`Metrics.errors` and its uncalled writer were deleted in favour of the per-operation `success`
the collector already recorded, so `DEGRADED` and `--quiet` became reachable; and the summary's
counters are now the achieved work rather than the size of the plan.

**And batching, which contradicted the flag outright.** One name no repository carries failed the
whole `apt install` and took the installable packages beside it down with it, so the flag
promised more than the default and delivered less. Under `--keep-going` a batch is one package,
which costs invocations — the thing this flag is explicitly willing to spend.

## G2

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B0b.**

**Is "Shall cannot read back" an `ok` row in `check`?** It was, and `ok` is also what decides the
exit code — so a dotfile no program could open printed as a green row at exit 0, repeatedly.

**BUILT: no.** The sentence was always honest; the marker was not. Absence and unavailability are
different answers and only one of them is knowable, and filing the unknowable one under the word
for a good answer throws that distinction away at the last step.

*The cost, stated because it is the reason this is a decision and not a fix:* a machine carrying
a `setting:` or a `@decrypt`ed `link:` — kinds nothing can read back by construction — now
reports `check` as needing attention permanently, and there is no command that clears it. If that
is noise rather than honesty, this is the entry to reverse.

## G3

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B0b.**

**What happens to a `link:` whose source file is not there?** A symlink was written to it. The
result exists, satisfies an `-L` test, and cannot be opened by anything.

**BUILT: refuse it, at plan time and at install time.** `dotfiles:` has always refused its
missing tree in the same position — *"is not a directory"* — on the identical string, so this is
one idea being answered the same way twice instead of two ways. The relative-source resolution
was unified with it in the same change: a relative source is read from the config repo, which is
what `dotfiles:` always did and `link:` never did.

## G4

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B8.**

**Is an empty `priority` file an answer?** It was accepted without a word, while a *missing* one
produced the best error in the program. Empty does not mean "no backends" either: an empty
enabled set was read as *every available backend*, on the stated premise that only a missing file
could produce one.

**BUILT: refuse it, in the same words as the missing file.** A file naming no manager is the same
state as no file, and the premise the fallback rested on is now true.

## G5

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B9. The one here most
likely to be reversed.**

**What does a hold mean under a bulk `upgrade`?** Nothing. `upgrade` filters its own plan against
the holds, correctly, and then hands the whole-system path to each manager's native upgrade-all,
which never sees the filtered plan. `--help` claimed `apt-mark hold` / `dnf versionlock` parity,
and both of those hold across a bulk upgrade — that is the entire reason they exist.

**BUILT: refuse the native whole-system upgrade while anything is held, and add `--ignore-holds`
as the opt-in.** The parity claim is gone from the help. Every scoped form of the verb honours
holds and needs no flag.

*The two roads not taken, because this is the entry to argue with:* defaulting `upgrade` to
per-package would bind the holds and silently narrow the verb from "upgrade this machine" to
"upgrade what Shall manages", which is a feature removal wearing a bugfix. Pushing the hold down
into the manager — `apt-mark hold` before the run, released after — is real parity and the right
answer eventually; it needs a native-hold adapter per backend and makes Shall the owner of
manager state it does not currently touch.

## G6

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B5.**

**May a package name begin with `-`?** It could. `PACKAGE_NAME_REGEX` admitted a leading hyphen,
so `composer:--version` passed every check and reached composer's argv as a flag — on a manager
Shall believed `--` would protect and which ignores it.

**BUILT: no, for every backend including the path-oriented ones.** No manager has a package
called `-rf`. The terminator table is the mechanism and stays; it is fifty booleans measured on
one image, and a guard that depends on all fifty being right is a guard with fifty ways to be
wrong. The composer row this shipped with has since been reversed on measurement — see `G6a`.

## G6a

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-14, from the nightly this entry's own change turned red.**

**Does composer honour `--`?** `G6` said no and set the row to non-terminating, citing three
consecutive nightlies of the differential probe. **None of those runs could have decided it.**
The probe believes a tool honours the terminator when the two runs agree, and composer answers a
bogus operand with the same "could not find a matching version" whether it read `--` or dropped
it. On two of the three hosts it never even got that far — `composer global search` answered `[]`
both ways, and on ubuntu-latest composer failed at `No composer.json present in the current
directory` before reaching the operand at all. Agreement between two runs that never resolved
anything is not evidence about a parser.

**BUILT: `true`. Composer honours the terminator, on every verb the registry drives.** Measured
with a **flag-shaped** operand, which is the only kind that makes the two hypotheses predict
different things:

| argv | answer |
| --- | --- |
| `composer global search --format=json --version` | `Composer version 2.10.2` — parsed as a flag |
| `composer global search --format=json -- --version` | searches packagist for `--version`, returns `sebastian/version` |

`global require` and `global remove` flip the same way: with the terminator `--version` is a
package name they fail to resolve, without it they print the version banner and exit 0. Composer
2.10.2, official image, 2026-08-14.

**What ships with it, because the row is the smaller half.** The probe now has three verdicts
rather than two: a pair of runs that agree is `Inconclusive` unless the run *without* the
terminator named the operand, which is the premise that makes agreement mean anything.
`tests/terminator_probe_tests.rs` had described this exact failure in prose — "a run that cannot
get there fails with the same exit code, never names the operand, and is indistinguishable to all
three signals from a parser that ate it" — and then defended only against a spurious
*difference*.

Note which way the old bug could err. A vacuous agreement can only ever move a row **into** the
terminating set, which is the unsafe half of `src/core/argv.rs`'s "the default is does not
terminate". It cost this row two wrong values in three days, in both directions.

## G7

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B2.**

**Is `pkg@version=1.6 @hold` two options or one?** One, silently: the lexer splits on the first
`@` and separates options on commas, so everything after a space was absorbed into the previous
option's *value*. `@sha256=abc @nosuchkey` produced a checksum that could not match, and `@hold`
written that way was inert. The same text was refused in first position and accepted in second.

**BUILT: refuse it, in the lexer.** Seven of the ten option grammars accepted it outright and the
three that refused were saved only by a downstream type check on a date, a count and an enum —
incidental protection that one free-form option would reopen. An `@` inside a value stays legal
(`@requires=@angular/cli`, `@source=github:owner/repo@v2`); whitespace immediately before one
does not, because nothing writes that on purpose.

## G8

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B3 and B4.**

**May a read verb print a clean bill built from a question that failed?** Two did. `shall hold`
answered `No packages are held.` at exit 0 over a manifest it could not resolve; `check drift`
printed *"System matches your manifests"* over managers that never answered, having dropped both
failures with `unwrap_or_default()`.

**BUILT: no — and the machine-readable contract carries it too.** `check drift --json` had a
`resources_unverifiable` key and no packages equivalent, so the distinction survived into the
contract for one half of the model and was lost for the other. There is a `packages_unverifiable`
now. `upgrade` keeps its tolerance of an unresolvable manifest deliberately: acting on the holds
it can see beats acting on none, and that is a different question from reporting on them.

## G9

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` B7.**

**Do the flags whose help says "(requires --dry-run)" require it?** Three of the four did not
enforce it — `shall sync --json` printed the human summary or nothing at all and exited 0, so a
script that forgot the pair got a success code and no document.

**BUILT: enforced for `sync`, `install` and `uninstall`; the sentence deleted from `upgrade`.**
`upgrade --security --json` prints what it remediated *after* remediating it, so it is not a
preview-only flag and enforcing the claim would have deleted a working answer to make a wrong
help string true.

*Enforced in `dispatch`, not by clap.* `requires = "dry_run"` resolves against the subcommand's
own arguments and `--dry-run` is global, so the constraint compiles, never fires for the case it
is meant to catch, and turns the documented working combination into a usage error — measured.
## G10

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-12, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-12.md` W4/P1. The widest
behaviour change in the `G` round.**

**Does `priority` gate anything except resolution?** It did not. A declaration naming an unlisted
backend was refused — and that was the whole of it. Detection walked PATH for all fifty-two
backends' binaries before it knew what had been asked, and every fan-out went to whatever happened
to be installed. Measured with `strace`: `shall list -b apt` cost **3,156** failed `statx` against
`shall list`'s 3,338, so naming one backend cost 99% of asking about all of them, and `priority`
bought nothing at all.

Invisible on an ordinary filesystem, where the whole run is 578 ms. The dominant cost the moment
PATH is long or slow — WSL inheriting 56 `/mnt/c` entries over 9p made `shall list -b apt` take
12.4 s, of which the `dpkg-query` it actually wanted took 0.02 s.

**BUILT: the file's own sentence is now true of detection and querying, not only of resolution.**
*"Listed = Shall uses it. Not listed = Shall does not use it at all."* A backend `priority` does
not name is never PATH-probed and never asked anything.

**How the audit was done, because "get one call site wrong and a backend silently disappears" was
the risk that made this worth a ruling rather than a fix.** `BackendRegistry::available()` was
**deleted** rather than filtered. It answered "what is on this machine" and every caller used it
for "what may Shall use", so renaming it out of existence made the compiler visit all twenty
sites, and not one of them could compile without choosing. The choices are in
`tests/priority_gates_every_fan_out_tests.rs` as a table, so the list is something somebody signed
off rather than a property of wherever the old method happened to be called.

**Two verbs see past `priority`, and both had to earn it:**

- **`init`** writes the priority file *from* what it detects. Gating detection here would read a
  file that does not exist yet, or gate the answer on the very list it is about to produce —
  either way an empty priority file and a repo that can do nothing.
- **`check health`** reports on managers that are **absent**, which the usable set cannot contain
  by definition. And an absent manager that `priority` names is not absent, it is *broken* — the
  one place the whole registry and the priority list are both needed at once.

**Everything else asks for the usable set**, including the four that delete: `remove-orphans`,
`purge-undeclared`, `clean-cache` and the `absent:` expansion. A manager the user told Shall not
to touch is one Shall must not be deleting through, and that argument is stronger than the
performance one.

*What a user will notice, stated plainly because it is the reason this is an entry:* on a machine
carrying package managers that are not in `priority`, `list`, `search`, `info`, `check drift`,
`adopt` and `update` now report on fewer of them. That is what the file always claimed to mean.
If a user's mental model was "priority orders the managers, it does not hide them", this is the
entry to reverse.

**And the failure mode it closes, which is the same one as `G4`.** `App::priority_backends()`
ended in `.unwrap_or_default()`, so a `priority` that would not resolve became an *empty list* —
and `UniversalSearch` read an empty enabled set as *every available backend*, on the stated
premise that only a missing file could produce one. Two swallowed answers composing into the
exact inversion of the rule. `Backends` carries the resolution failure instead of an empty set,
and refuses where the question is asked.

## H1

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` F13 (raised there as Q-C).**

**Is a declaration Shall could not act on a failure, or a declaration that does not apply here?**
`sudo`'s stock `secure_path` is `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin`,
which does not contain `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.bun/bin` or `~/.local/bin` — so `cargo`, `bun` and `uv`
are invisible to anything run through `sudo`, installed exactly where their own installers put
them. Measured in a stock Ubuntu container: `sync --yes` with three declarations warned three
times, installed nothing, printed no transaction summary, and exited **0** — the code named
`Exit::Converged`. `shall check`, on the same unchanged state one line later, reported drift and
exited 2. Alternating the two commands repeated it: 0, 2, 0, 2.

**RULED: a failure.** The underlying distinction was already ruled one command over.
`target-state.md` §Q2 defines **critical** as *"it is installed, or `priority` names it, and it
cannot work"* — so a `priority`-named manager that cannot be reached is a fact about a broken
machine, not an inapplicable line. `check` was told that. `sync` was not.

**Exit 1, not 2, and the table decides it.** `U21` reserves 2 for *a read-only command that
looked and found work to do*; `sync` is not read-only. 1 is *Shall could not carry the command
out*, which is what happened, and it is the code a failed install already returns — a declaration
that never reached its manager and one whose manager refused it are the same fact about the run.

**A partial skip is the case that matters.** Three of three is the container reproduction; three
of four is the ordinary shape and is worse, because something did install and the summary reads
like a successful transaction. The count is therefore per-declaration and not a whole-run
boolean.

**What made this expressible at all.** F4's `SkipKind` split: `SyncChanges::skipped` carried
declined removals and skipped installs in one list, and a declined removal must **not** make a
sync fail — it is the guard working, and it is the ordinary state of every adopted machine.
Without the two kinds distinguished in the type, this ruling would have to be inferred from a
sentence.

## H2

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` (raised there as Q-A).**

**Should a read-only command that finds work exit 2?** `target-state.md` says exit 2 *"means a
read-only command found work to do"*, and only `check` ever built `Error::Differences`. Measured:
`shall plan` printed *"1 install(s), 0 removal(s)"* and exited **0**; `shall list --outdated`
listed dozens of outdated packages and exited **0**.

**RULED: yes for `plan`, no for `list --outdated`.** `plan` answers the question `check` answers
*and* writes the machine-readable artifact a script consumes, so a pipeline that branches on
drift reaches for `plan` and is told the machine has converged, every time. A listing is
different in kind: its subject is inventory rather than a verdict, and a listing that exited
non-zero for having contents would surprise every script that has ever piped one.

`plan`'s condition is `check`'s condition — the same quantities in the same combination — because
the rule this repository keeps paying for is that two readings of one machine disagree.

`U21` settled the table before these commands existed; this is the first command it did not
cover, and it is an addition to that table rather than a change to it.

## H3

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` F7 (raised there as Q-B).**

**`outdated`: remove the name, or add the subcommand?** `Class::of` classified `"outdated"` as
`EveryBackend`. There is no `outdated` subcommand — it is `shall list --outdated`, a flag — so the
arm was dead.

**RULED: remove the name. The flag stays a flag.** Promoting it would be a user-visible addition
nobody asked for, and `list --outdated` is the spelling every existing script uses.

**The dead arm was never the defect, and this is the half worth writing down.** `Class::of`'s own
doc said *"the list is asserted against `--help` by `tests/latency_budget_tests.rs` — a name that
stops existing fails that test rather than sitting here forever, which is the mistake `undo` made
in two harness exemption lists."* That test did not read the table. It read a `NAMED` array of
twenty-four hand-typed strings beside it, and the array omitted `outdated` — so **the failure the
gate guarded against was the failure it demonstrated.** A `match` gives a test nothing to
iterate, which is *why* the copy existed; the table is data now (`CLASSIFIED`), exposed as
`classified_names()`, and the gate reads it.

## H4

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` F10/F11. Ruled against the
recommendation that was put to the owner, on the principle he gave instead of an answer.**

**Should `sandbox.fallback_allowed` default to `false`?** On any Linux host without `bwrap`,
`shall run -p pkg@sandbox -- cmd` ran the command **unconfined, with an unmodified environment**,
and said so only at `debug!`. Measured in a container: `touch /srv/escaped` landed on the host
filesystem, rc=0, nothing on stdout or stderr. The recommendation put to the owner was to flip
the default so an explicit `@sandbox` refuses rather than degrades.

**RULED: no.** A feature here is built fully and is not withdrawn because it is hard or because
it could be misused; within reason, people are smart. A user who asked for confinement on a host
that cannot provide it is owed **the fact**, plainly and at `warn!`, not a program that decides
on their behalf that they may not proceed. The escape hatch stays open and stays the default;
what changes is that it can no longer be taken silently.

**What was built instead, and it is more than a log level.**

- `Sandbox::decide` is the **one** place that answers *"is a mechanism in force, and if not may
  this proceed"*. `run`, `shell` and `wrap` each answered it separately before, which is how the
  one user-visible `warn!` in `run.rs` became unreachable: its condition (`can_sandbox == false`
  and `fallback_allowed == true`) was already folded into the predicate in front of it, because
  `Sandbox::is_available` returned `bwrap_available() || fallback_allowed` — a constant `true`
  under the default. It did not answer *"is a sandbox available"*; it answered *"is a sandbox
  available, or are we permitted to skip it"*, and every caller read it as the first.
- `Confinement` is returned beside the command rather than inferred from it. An unconfined
  fallback and a real `bwrap` invocation are the same type — `Command` — so a caller that wants
  to claim a boundary now has to hold the variant that grants one.
- **`require_bwrap` is wired**, and outranks `fallback_allowed`. It was declared, documented
  (*"On Linux, if true, Shall will fail if 'bwrap' is missing"*), defaulted and serialised, and
  **read by nothing** — while its Windows twin `windows_require_sandbox` was checked. An
  administrator who read the configuration reference, decided silent unconfined execution was
  unacceptable on their fleet, and wrote the setting got byte-for-byte the same unconfined run.
  That is what makes this ruling safe to make: the knob that closes the hole is now a knob.
- The sentence *"Falling back to PATH isolation"* is deleted. There was no PATH isolation — it
  returned `Command::new(cmd).args(args)` with an unmodified environment. `hooks.rs` records
  having caught this exact shape once already: *"It was called `setup_lua_sandbox`, which claimed
  a boundary this does not build."*

**Windows keeps its low-integrity launch**, and it is reported as `Confinement::None` rather than
as a mechanism: it does lower the token, so deleting it would remove a real reduction, and it is
not a sandbox, so naming it one would be the claim the type exists to stop.

## H5

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, from `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md` axis 3. Deferred twice before
this; the grade doc's condition was that it be *measured and decided*, not deferred a third
time.**

**Is `StateResolver` to be split, and are the three `Skipped` structs to be collapsed?**

**Measured first, because both previous deferrals were arguments without numbers.**
`src/app/sync/resolver.rs` is 2,021 lines, of which **1,483 are production** (the `#[cfg(test)]`
module opens at 1,618). `StateResolver` has **38 methods**, and they fall into four groups that
are visible from their names alone:

| group | methods | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| construction | 5 | `new`, `upgrading`, `with_vars`, `as_if_active`, `recording_locks` |
| priority / host facts | 4 | `priority`, `priority_body`, `priority_for_host`, `host_backends` |
| variables | 7 | the `resolve_vars*` family, `vars_at_last_sync`, `vars_provider`, `vars_vocabulary` |
| model expansion | 9 | `parse_everything`, `resolve_model`, `expand_generators`, `expand_regexes`, `match_catalogue`, `probe_bare_names`, `apply_locks`, … |
| single-spec resolution | 10 | `resolve_spec`, `parse_and_probe_spec`, `validate_line`, `ask`, `ask_the_chain`, `satisfies_constraint`, … |

**RULED: not split, and the variables group is the one that would go if it ever is.**

The four groups are not four responsibilities held by accident — they are one pipeline with four
stages, and every stage reads the same three fields (`config`, `registry`, `layout`) plus the same
two caches. Splitting them produces types that call each other while threading the identical
state, which is the shape `cfg ad22d` has already paid for once: *"the god object dissolved, and
the parameter list it became."* A 38-method type whose methods all operate on one resolution is
not the `&App` problem in miniature; `&App` was a bag of unrelated services, and this is a
resolver.

**The variables group is the exception and is named here so the next reader does not re-derive
it.** It is the only cluster with its own cache, its own vocabulary, and callers outside the
resolution pipeline (`vars_provider`, `vars_at_last_sync`). If this type is ever cut, that is the
seam — 7 methods out, one field of shared state, no back-edges. It is not cut now because the cut
is worth doing when something needs it, and nothing does.

**The three `Skipped` structs: also not collapsed, and the reason is that they are three
records rather than three implementations.** `planner::Skipped` now carries `SkipKind` — two
*opposite* meanings that one list held, which is `F4` and is fixed. `rebuild::Skipped` answers a
third question ("left out of this rebuild"), and `adopt::Skipped` carries a whole `Package`
because it writes a manifest rather than a report. A single generic record — `Skipped<K>` over a
per-domain kind — is the shape that would unify them, and it unifies three fields and no
behaviour. The repo's rule is against a *second implementation of one thing*; this is one struct
shape appearing in three domains, which is what a struct shape does.

*Both halves of this ruling are reversible and cost the same tomorrow as today, which is the test
for whether deferring was ever the real answer. It was not; deciding was.*

## H6

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, owner ruling, built in the same commit. Raised OPEN the same
day off three grading documents (`GRADE-2026-08-11` §competitive, `-08-12`, `-08-13` axis 5),
which had carried it as prose and entered it here in none of them.** A gap recorded only in a
review is a gap nobody is accountable for.

**RULED: yes, and opted into per step.** `@on=` on an `exec:` line names the verb that runs it —
`sync` (the default), `upgrade`, or `both`. `upgrade` now runs the steps that name it, after the
packages, through the same approval gate, ledger and journal `sync` uses. A manifest that says
nothing means exactly what it meant yesterday.

**Why not simply run every `exec:` from `upgrade`.** The approval ledger records *what content
may run here*; it has never recorded *which verb may run it*. A blanket widening therefore takes
every `exec:` line in every manifest that already exists — approved by people consenting to
`sync` running them — and hands it to a verb that has never executed a user script. The approval
on file would still be valid, and would be answering a question nobody had asked.

**Three values rather than a comma-separated list**, because options are themselves separated by
commas: `@on=sync,upgrade` parses as `on=sync` plus a second option named `upgrade`, which is
`F3`'s boundary confusion invited in through the value grammar. Rule in `target-state.md`,
reasoning in `why.md`.

*The test for this was watched failing — and the first version of it did not fail, which is the
part worth keeping. Both `exec:` lines needed `@runs=always`: with the default run-once ceiling
the plain script's count stays 1 whether or not `upgrade` reached for it, so the assertion that
`upgrade` leaves other scripts alone passed against the exact widening it exists to reject.*

**Should `shall upgrade` cover the things that are not packages?**

`upgrade` upgrades *managed packages*. It does not touch firmware (`fwupd`), OS release upgrades,
editor and shell plugin managers, tracked git repositories, or the component updaters inside
tools that have their own (`rustup`, `gcloud`). `topgrade` does, and this is the one axis where a
competitor does something Shall cannot. `upgrade` is also the verb where a user coming from that
tool will expect parity without reading anything.

**Why it is a ruling and not a fix.** Every item on that list is a command Shall would run
against a machine on the user's behalf, chosen by Shall rather than declared by the user — which
is the opposite of how everything else here works. `sync` acts on declarations; a `topgrade`-style
upgrade acts on *discovery*. That is a change in what the program is, not an addition to what it
does, and it is exactly the kind of thing this register exists to keep out of a commit message.

**Recommendation, offered as one:** build it as declarations rather than as discovery — an
`upgrade:` surface where each non-package step is a declared line with its own adapter, so the
machinery that already exists (the guard, the journal, `--dry-run`, hooks) applies unchanged and
nothing runs that a user did not write down. That keeps the parity claim honest without Shall
acquiring an opinion about a machine it was not told about. The cost is that it is not
zero-configuration the way `topgrade` is, and a user who wanted `topgrade` may have wanted exactly
that.

**MEASURED 2026-08-13, after `H7` closed on a false premise. This one is smaller than it reads
too, and the recommendation above is half built already.**

- **The declared-line mechanism exists.** `exec:PATH @runs=always` is a declaration that runs a
  command on every sync, approval-gated by `shall lock` (an unapproved script refuses the run by
  name), recorded in the journal, and undone by `@undo=` when the line goes. That is the whole of
  what an `upgrade:` surface would need underneath it, and none of it has to be built.
- **`upgrade` does not run extras at all.** `src/verbs/upgrade.rs` names them nowhere, and a
  fixture confirms it: an always-run `exec:` fires under `sync -y` and not under `upgrade`. So a
  user who runs `shall upgrade` weekly — the verb a `topgrade` user reaches for — never runs their
  firmware step, however correctly they declared it.
- **What is left is therefore two questions, not a subsystem.** *(a)* Should `upgrade` also run
  always-run declared steps? *(b)* Should Shall ship adapters for the common ones (`fwupd`,
  `rustup`, `gcloud`) so the step is a name rather than a hand-written script?

**(a) is the ruling, and it is not a small one despite being a small change.** It makes a verb
that has never executed user scripts start executing them. The approval gate covers *what* runs;
it says nothing about *which verb* runs it, and somebody who approved a script for `sync` did not
thereby approve it for `upgrade`. Recommended **yes, gated on the step opting in** — a step that
wants to run on upgrade says so on its own line — so the widening is written down per step
rather than inherited by every `exec:` already in every manifest.

*(b) is `H8`, and it is an entry rather than a sentence here for the reason this whole pair
exists: a question left inside an answered entry is a question nobody owes an answer on.*

## H7

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, by measurement, and the answer is that the premise was false.**
Raised OPEN earlier the same day off three grading documents; closed the same day by building the
fixture instead of trusting the sentence.

**Should `check` report managed-file *content* drift, given that `sync` heals it?**

**It already does.** Measured, not reasoned: a config declaring
`link:mydot @target=<path>,content=hello`, synced, then the destination overwritten by hand.

```text
before tampering:   ok  drift  the machine matches your files
after tampering:    ->  drift  0 to install, 0 to remove, 1 to place, 0 to undo
```

**Why the code reading said otherwise.** `link` registers no `Queryable`, and
`ChangePlanner::spec_is_missing` returns `Ok(true)` for a backend without one — so reading the
planner alone says every `link:` line is pending for ever. It never reaches the planner. A `link:`
is an **extra**, not a package, and `Extras::changes` probes it through `in_effect`, which
compares inline `@content=` byte for byte, compares a symlink's target against the resolved
source, and reads the destination back for a plain file. That probe was the `B0b` work; the
finding this entry came from was written on 2026-08-11, before it, and was carried forward by two
later reviews without being re-run.

**What is deliberately still `None` there, with the reason in the code:** a rendered template and
a decrypted secret are not their source, and comparing them would mean running the transform. They
report `unverifiable`, which places — and `F12` gave `unverifiable` a count on the drift row, so
the one thing `check` cannot verify is now the one thing it says it cannot verify.

**What the finding did leave, and it is fixed in the same commit as this entry.** The `config` row
counted `state.total_present()` — packages — so a dotfiles-only manifest read `0 package(s)
declared` while declaring plenty. True, and the sentence a user reads to confirm their file was
understood at all. It now counts resources beside packages, and says nothing about them when there
are none.

*The lesson is the register's own: a gap recorded in prose and never re-measured stops being a
gap and stays written down. Three reviews carried this one; the fixture took four minutes.*


## H8

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-13, owner ruling, built in the same commit. Split out of `H6`
earlier the same day and open for about an hour.** The ruling, in the owner's words: *"basically
you are describing having aliases come defined in a text file and shipped. so yes."* Which is
what it is — `exec:step/rustup` is an alias for a command, and the aliases ship as data.

**RULED: build it, as rows compiled into the binary.**

- **`exec:step/NAME`**, where `step/` is a reserved first segment. `exec:` has always taken a
  path, so a bare `exec:rustup` would be both a file in the config repo and a catalogue name with
  nothing in the line to say which. A resolution order that tries one and falls back to the other
  is how a typo becomes a different program; a reserved prefix means neither can shadow the
  other.
- **No approval, and that asymmetry is the point.** `src/model/upgrade_steps.toml` is
  `include_str!`'d, which is the status `builtin_backends.toml` already settled in its own
  header: *"this file is compiled into the binary, so there is no II.12 question to ask about
  it."* A script the user writes still needs `shall lock`. You approve what you wrote; you
  approved the binary by installing it. Had a catalogued step needed approving too, the
  catalogue would buy nothing — the user would still have to go and look at something before it
  ran, which is the friction it exists to remove.
- **Rows, never shipped scripts.** A `.sh` in a release is code travelling to machines, which is
  the supply-chain question the approval gate exists to ask. A row is a fact about a tool:
  `rustup` is upgraded by `rustup update`. It reaches the executor as argv, so nothing in it is
  parsed by a shell.
- **The row carries its own `on` and `runs` defaults**, so `exec:step/rustup` with nothing else
  written is run by `upgrade`, every time. A line may override either; a default a user cannot
  override is a rule wearing a default's name.
- **A step whose tool is absent is skipped and says so.** One config, many machines: the laptop
  has `rustup` and the server does not, and the server has nothing to do rather than something to
  report.

**Three rows to start — `fwupd`, `rustup`, `gcloud` — and one of them is deliberately partial.**
`fwupdmgr update` writes firmware, and a text file that flashes a laptop's BIOS unattended on a
weekly `shall upgrade` is not a convenience. The shipped row is `fwupdmgr refresh`, which fetches
metadata so a human can be told what is available and decide. Somebody who genuinely wants
unattended flashing writes their own `exec:` line and approves it — exactly the friction that
decision deserves.

**And the second question answered itself.** *"Does declaring one imply running it?"* — yes, and
it needed no new statement to say so: a catalogued step is an `exec:` line, so there is one
verb-shaped statement in the grammar and not two. The `Planned` enum in `app/apply/execs.rs` is
where the two arms meet, and everything after it — the ceiling, the ledger, the write-ahead
record, the dry-run note — is shared.

*Original entry follows.*

**Status when raised: OPEN — 2026-08-13, split out of `H6` when that was ruled.** `H6` answered *should
`upgrade` run declared steps* (yes, opted into per step, built). This is its second half, and it
is here rather than in `H6`'s prose because an unanswered question inside an ANSWERED entry is
exactly the shape that left the competitor gaps unowned for three grading rounds.

**Should Shall ship a catalogue of upgrade steps, so a step is a name rather than a script?**

Today `exec:./bin/firmware.sh @on=upgrade` means the user writes the script. `topgrade`'s
selling point is that they do not: it knows `fwupd`, `rustup`, `gcloud components`, `nvim`'s
plugin managers and thirty more, and running it is one word. Parity is *possible* with what
`H6` built and is not *convenient*, and convenience is the whole of that tool's claim.

**The shape it would take is already in this repo, and it is not a pile of shipped scripts.**
`firewall_adapters.toml`, `setting_stores.toml` and `init_providers.toml` are declarative rows
describing how to drive a tool — detection, the command, the arguments — loaded through
`read_approved_definitions`. An upgrade-step catalogue is the same thing with a different
surface, and that matters for the reason a shipped `.sh` would be a supply-chain question and a
TOML row naming `fwupd refresh` is a fact about `fwupd`.

**What still has to be decided, and why it is not a detail:**

- **Does a catalogued step still need approving?** A hand-written `exec:` does, because it is
  the user's code. A row that says `rustup update` is Shall's, reviewed in this repository — and
  if it needs `shall lock` anyway, the convenience the catalogue exists for is mostly gone.
- **Does declaring one imply running it?** `upgrade:rustup` reads like a declaration; the thing
  it declares is a *verb*, which is the bend `exec:` already makes in the model (see
  `target-state.md`). Two statements that are verbs is a second implementation of the awkward
  case, and the repo's rule is to have one.

**Recommendation, offered as one:** build it as `@on=`-carrying `exec:` lines sourced from an
adapter file rather than as a new statement — one verb-shaped statement, not two — and require
approval once per catalogue *version* rather than per line, so a user vouches for the catalogue
they are on instead of for thirty rows they did not write.

## J1

**Status: ANSWERED — confirmed 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation. Built 2026-08-14, owner ruling by delegation, from the nightly.**

**What should guard `purge-undeclared` on a machine where the ratio is the only thing guarding
it?** Raised after the macOS nightly ran an unrefused sweep of 276 packages. Two findings, one
question:

- **The ratio silently got weaker and nobody chose that.** II.11 refuses below `managed /
  about-to-delete = 0.1`. `d1b3618` correctly stopped the undeclared crawl surveying `service:`
  and `link:` — a sweep must never propose to delete every running service — and that same list
  is the ratio's denominator. Several hundred entries left it on every host. The rule did not
  change; the population it measures did. Measured: macOS 43/276 = 0.156, cleared the bar,
  proceeded. A Windows box after `adopt`: 133/340 = 0.391, exits 0 and sweeps 340.
- **Outside Linux the protected list matched nothing.** It read `windows`, `win32`, `kernel32`,
  `ntdll.dll` / `darwin`, `xnu` — the operating system's vocabulary, not any package manager's.
  No manager has ever reported a package called `kernel32`. The effective set was the three
  shared names, `sudo`/`bash`/`shall`.

**The owner's ruling, in his words: *"do what you think, but make sure it favors power users who
will not shoot themselves, and if it might be unsafe, just make it configurable"*,** and on the
second: *"i dont think it is deliberate — do what you want."*

**BUILT, both to that principle.**

- **`[guard] purge_ratio`, defaulting to the same 0.1.** No behaviour changes by default. The
  threshold stops being a `const` because what it measures moved underneath it once already, and
  a number that an unrelated fix can silently re-scale is one its owner should be able to reach.
  `0.0` turns it off, written down and tested rather than left to fall out of the arithmetic —
  someone who purges on purpose and often should say so once in a file, not remember a flag.
- **The platform lists name packages the managers name.** Deliberately narrow, because a name
  here is friction for whoever genuinely manages that package. Windows gets the VC++
  redistributables, the .NET runtimes and `git` — Windows ships none of them itself, and Shall
  keeps the config repo's history in git, so removing it leaves the machine fine and the undo
  gone. macOS gets only `ca-certificates` and `openssl*`: brew's `git` and `curl` are a
  preference, since macOS ships its own in `/usr/bin`, and protecting them would be friction
  bought with no safety.

**Not built: making the ratio machine-wide.** It was the obvious repair for the first finding and
it is the wrong one. A user who has narrowed `priority` to one manager would be weighed against
every package on the machine and refused a purge that is entirely correct — a rule that punishes
precisely the person who configured Shall most deliberately.

## J2

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-16. Owner: *"yes, of course. this is a bug."* Built in the same
commit; the caveat below shipped with it.**

**A `setting:` is never read back, so a sync that changes one reports that it changed nothing.**
Measured on Windows 11 with `target/debug/shall.exe` against the real registry, three syncs over
one declaration:

| | declaration | registry after | what Shall printed |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `@value=alpha`, key absent | `alpha` | *nothing* |
| B | `@value=alpha`, unchanged | `alpha` | `already up to date` |
| C | `@value=beta` | **`beta`** | `already up to date` |

C is the finding: the machine changed and the report says it did not. `plan` is worse, because it
contradicts itself in two consecutive lines — *"system already matches desired state (no
changes)"*, then *"the plan written to shall-plan.json is not empty"*, exit 2.

**Why.** `apply::extras::in_effect` answers `None` for `ResourceKind::Setting`, and `None` means
*unverifiable*, which places. The reason it gives is:

> `setting:` reads back through an adapter that has no "current value" command; the only way to
> know is to write and see.

**That sentence is false, and the code one layer down proves it.** Every row in
`setting_stores.toml` carries `read` (and `system_read`), `backends/setting.rs` has `already_set`
to compare a store's answer against a declaration, and its own `install` calls exactly that pair
before deciding whether to write. The probe `in_effect` says does not exist is the probe the
installer already uses.

**Three things follow from the same `None`,** which is why this is one question and not three: the
change is invisible in the summary; the value is re-written on every sync for ever; and `check`
can never come clean on a machine with a `setting:` line — which is the cost `G2` recorded when it
ruled that *"Shall cannot read back"* may not be an `ok` row.

**The question, and the ruling.** Should `in_effect` answer for `setting:` by running the store's
`read` and comparing with `already_set` — the same pair `K::Link` above it was already given?
**Yes.** `check` goes clean where it never could before, and a converged sync stops touching the
store.

**What was built.** `SettingBackendCore::holds` is the one question — split the name, pick the
adapter, resolve the scope, read, compare — and both halves ask it: `in_effect` for the report
and `SettingInstallable::install` for the write. Two answers to *is this key already right* is
how the reporting half came to say **nothing to do** about a key the other half was rewriting, so
the fix is one function rather than a second copy of the comparison.

**The caveat shipped with the ruling.** `read` fails for reasons that are not "the value differs"
— a schema `gsettings` does not know, a registry hive the user cannot open, a `@scope=system`
line against a store with no machine-wide commands. Those stay `None`, never `Some(false)`: a
failed read reported as *not in effect* would make every sync rewrite the key it cannot see,
which is the old behaviour wearing a confident face. So the read must **exit clean** to count,
which is `probe_output`'s contract and not `run_output`'s — the latter hands back `Ok("")` for a
command that failed but explained itself, and an empty reading compares unequal to every value
there is. That distinction is one of the four tests.

**What it does not close.** A store whose read fails on an *unset* key — `reg query` on a value
that is not there — is still unanswerable rather than absent, so it is placed. That is exactly
what it did before, and `gsettings`, which returns the schema default for an unset key, answers
properly. Distinguishing "unset" from "unreadable" needs a per-store rule no adapter row carries.

## J3

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-16. Owner: *"i dont get this so much, but do what a user would want
— make it intuitive, easy, flexible and powerful."* The winner is no longer one answer: it is
the owner for a repository package and the helper for a foreign one, built in the same commit.**

**Three backends over one package database made every Arch machine unconvergeable.** `pacman`,
`yay` and `paru` are three clients of one libalpm database: all three answer `-Qe` with the same
lines. Measured in the arch integration image, `pacman -Qe`, `yay -Qe` and `paru -Qe` each
returned the same 20 packages, and every surface that enumerates installed software across
backends counted each package once per client.

What that cost, in the order it happened:

| step | what Shall did |
|---|---|
| `install jq` | wrote one line, `jq`, resolving to `pacman` — correct |
| `adopt` | skipped `pacman:jq` as already declared, then wrote `paru:jq` **and** `yay:jq` |
| `uninstall jq` | planned `install 0 remove 3`, backends `pacman, paru, yay` |
| the removal | pacman removed jq; paru and yay were then asked to remove a package that was gone |

The second and third removals returned `error: `paru` failed (exit 1): error: target not found:
jq`, which failed the sync. Every later section of the harness failed against the same two
declarations — 40 of 45 checks in one run, none of them about the thing being tested.

**The same shape, three more places.** `shall list` printed 203 packages as 609 rows. The
undeclared crawl — which `purge-undeclared` deletes from and whose ratio is the guard on that
deletion — counted every package three times. And `shall uninstall jq --absent` asks which
managers hold jq and writes an `absent:` line per holder, so it wrote three; an `absent:` line is
permanent, so that machine would have failed *every* subsequent sync, for ever, with no line to
delete that would fix it.

**What was built.** One table, `READS_THE_DATABASE_OF` (then in `backends/capability.rs`,
now in `backends/shared_database.rs`), naming the
client and the backend whose database it reads (`yay â†’ pacman`, `paru â†’ pacman`), and three
functions over it. Adopt keys candidates on the database rather than the client; the crawl and
`list` collapse rows the same way; `--absent` collapses holders. The claim is made **before** the
already-declared filter, not after, because that filter is what let the clients through:
`pacman:jq` was declared, so pacman skipped it, and nothing had claimed the name by the time the
clients were asked.

**The rule for what belongs in that table: a shared *installed* database, not similar software.**
`npm` and `pnpm` have their own global prefixes and `pip` and `pipx` their own directories — two
installs of one name, where removing one leaves the other. Those are not this relation and a
`npm:jq` row survives beside a `pacman:jq` row.

**The reversible part.** Where a client and the owner both hold a package, the **owner** wins the
row. That is what makes the surviving row actionable — `pacman -Rs` removes an AUR package that
`yay` installed, and a row naming `yay` would be a removal the user cannot repeat with the manager
printed next to it. Where no owner answered (`shall list --backend yay`), the first client stands,
so filtering to a client never returns an empty listing.

**The ruling, and what a user wants.** A declaration is a thing you can delete and put back —
that is what a manifest *is*. `pacman:<aur package>` fails that test in one direction: pacman
removes it and cannot reinstall it, because it is in no sync repository. So the winner is not a
constant. It is **the owner for a package the repositories supply and the helper for one they do
not**, which is the `pacman -Qm` foreign set the previous entry named as the alternative.

**What was built.** `Queryable::foreign_to_repositories` — `None` from every manager that draws
no such distinction, `pacman -Qmq` for the one that does — and `ForeignSets`, which asks it once
per run and only on a machine where an owner *and* one of its clients are both present. Both
collapses consult it: the cross-backend listing (`list`, the undeclared crawl) and the holder
list (`--absent`), so the two cannot answer one question differently. `adopt` stands the owner
aside on the foreign set, and its already-declared check moved to the **database** rather than
the client — otherwise a `pacman:jq` written by an earlier run would let `yay:jq` in beside it,
which is the duplicate this whole relation exists to stop.

**Three bounds, stated rather than left to be found.**

- **The owner only stands aside when a client is answering in the same run.** On an Arch box
  with no helper installed, `pacman:<aur package>` is still the best row there is; losing it
  would drop the package from the listing entirely.
- **The manager-level collapse is untouched.** `check health` refreshes managers, not packages,
  and there is no package there to ask about — so `pacman -Sy` still stands for all three.
- **A probe that fails leaves the owner speaking for everything**, which is the behaviour this
  replaced. It is read through `probe_output`, so a refused flag is *unknown* rather than
  *nothing is foreign*: an empty answer read out of a failure would attribute every AUR package
  to pacman again, quietly.

Moved out of `capability.rs` in the same change: that module's header says it is deliberately a
static table rather than a question put to the registry, and this is now a question put to the
registry. It is `backends/shared_database.rs`.

## J4

**Status: HALF RULED 2026-08-16.** The owner ruled the substance — selective pinning, a config
switch for each part, an error that explains itself, and selective upgrade. **The remaining half
is one question: does a bare `shall lock` keep freezing all three axes?** It does today and it
still does; `[lock] axes` is how a machine narrows it. See *What was ruled* below.

**A plain `sync` honours a version lockfile that `shall lock` writes as a side effect, so a
machine stops syncing the day its archive drops a recorded version.** Found by the storage leg of
nightly `31925296671`, reproduced end to end on the `ubuntu` integration image.

The chain, and every step of it is measured:

| | what runs | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shall lock` — the harness runs it to **approve an `exec:`** | `Lock: pinned 106 package version(s) to locks/versions.json`, including `"apt:libudev1": "255.4-1ubuntu8.17"` |
| 2 | anything upgrades those packages, or the archive rolls | the recorded version is no longer in the index |
| 3 | `shall sync --yes` — **no `--locked` anywhere** | `StateResolver::prefer_locks` defaults to `true`, so `apply_locks` injects the recorded version |
| 4 | `apt` | `E: Version '…' for 'libudev1' was not found`, exit 100, sync exits 1 |

The reproduction prints the storage leg's message verbatim, down to the manifest line numbers
(113 for `libsystemd0`, 116 for `libudev1`).

**Three mechanisms were ruled out before this one, and they are recorded so nobody re-walks
them.** The adoption manifest carries no version — `adoption_options` is implemented by exactly
one backend (`service.rs`, which contributes `@status=`), so `apt:libudev1` is written bare. The
state registry records `"version": null` for these packages. And `adopt` followed by `sync` never
creates `locks/versions.json` at all: only `lock`, `plan` and `sync` write it, which is what made
the first reproduction attempt come back clean.

**This is two questions wearing one symptom, and they can be ruled separately.**

**(a) Should `shall lock` pin every managed package's version?** Its user asked to approve a
script. It pinned 106 packages. `plan.rs` describes the file as written *"so a later `sync
--locked` reproduces those exact versions"*, which is a purpose nobody invoked here.

**(b) Should a plain `sync` prefer a recorded version at all?** `prefer_locks: true` is the
default and `upgrading()` is the only thing that clears it, so the file written for `--locked` is
in force for every sync. The doc comment says `--locked`; the default says always.

**And a consequence either ruling has to cover: what should happen when a pinned version has left
the archive?** Today the answer is a failed sync with a manager's error and no suggestion. There
is no path back that does not involve the user finding `--upgrade` or deleting a file they did not
know they had.

**Recommendation, offered as one and not built.** Keep the pin — a recorded version is the point
of recording it — and fix the two edges: `lock` should record versions only when asked to (or say
loudly that it did), and a sync that cannot satisfy a *recorded* pin (as opposed to a typed one)
should report the drift and name `--upgrade`, rather than handing the user apt's exit 100. A
version somebody typed stays fatal, on the reasoning `pins.rs` already gives: *"a version you
typed is a decision"*. A version Shall recorded on their behalf is not.

**Raised rather than built because every option changes what a user sees** — which sync fails,
which command records what, and what a machine does the morning after a security update.

### What was ruled, 2026-08-16

**Half of what this entry asked for already existed, and saying so is part of the ruling** — the
gap was never "Shall cannot scope a pin", it was that the scope had no name for a whole manager
and no home in the config. `shall lock versions curl` pinned one package before this change;
`shall lock scripts` approved an `exec:` without pinning anything, and would have prevented the
reproduction above outright. `shall upgrade curl`, `shall upgrade --backend apt`, `--security`
and `--except` all shipped long ago, and `upgrade` already re-records the pins it moved past.

Four things were built:

1. **`--backend` on `lock` and `unlock`.** A class is a manager, and it goes on a flag rather
   than being inferred from a bare word, because `apt:apt` is a real package on every Debian
   machine — `shall lock versions apt` has to keep meaning the package called `apt`. Names and a
   class intersect: `--backend apt curl` is apt's curl and not cargo's. The flag needs the
   `versions` axis and is **refused** on the others rather than silently matching nothing, since
   a backend lock's keys are bare names and a script id's prefix (`after_install:`) is a ledger
   namespace, not a manager.

2. **A `[lock]` table in `preferences.toml`, three keys, every default the shipped behaviour.**
   `axes` narrows what a bare `lock` freezes; `versions` names which managers get pins (`["*"]`
   by default); `replay` is whether an ordinary `sync` installs recorded versions. That third
   key is the root of the reproduction above and had no name at all before — `prefer_locks` was
   hardcoded `true`, so the only way to decline it was `--upgrade` on every sync for ever.
   `replay = false` keeps the file as a drift record, which `check` still reads and `sync
   --locked` still reproduces from, without a recorded version becoming an install argument.

3. **The failure explains itself.** A manager that cannot get a pinned version now says the pin
   is in `locks/versions.json`, that Shall recorded it, and names `shall upgrade <pkg>`, `shall
   unlock versions <pkg>`, `sync --upgrade` and `[lock] replay = false`. It is **derived from
   disk, not carried on the spec**: the lockfile is read at the moment of failure and asked
   whether the version the manager quoted is the one recorded for that package. `V`'s rule
   against a `was_hand_written` bit stands untouched, and nothing here is set by anybody.
   Advice is withheld when the manager's complaint does not quote the pin, so a dead mirror or a
   full disk is never blamed on a lockfile.

4. **`[lock] versions` is enforced in `build_and_write_locks`, not in the `lock` command** —
   `heal` reconciles the same file, and a class filter on one writer would have `heal` quietly
   put back every pin `lock` was configured not to write.

**What was deliberately not changed.** A version somebody *typed* still fails hard, on the
reasoning `pins.rs` already gives: a version you typed is a decision. Only the recorded kind gets
the explanation. And `refresh_version_locks` still moves an existing pin even for a manager
`[lock] versions` now excludes — the pin exists, and refusing to move it would freeze it at a
stale version, which is the Z2 bug the function was written to prevent.

## J5

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-16. Four questions put to the owner and four answers, all in one
sitting. Build order and the coverage bound are below; nothing here was built before it was
ruled.**

**On NixOS, `nix profile install` is a side door the operating system does not know about.** It
sits outside the system generation, no `nixos-rebuild` accounts for it, and it makes Shall's
declarations and NixOS's declarations two sources of truth for one machine. That is the exact
condition this tool exists to remove, so Shall on NixOS should write the **system configuration**
and let NixOS execute it.

**Before any of it: the published binary could not start on NixOS at all.** Measured 2026-08-16
by mounting Ubuntu's own `/bin/echo` into `nixos/nix` — exit 127, *"cannot execute: required
file not found"* — because a `-gnu` target hard-codes `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and NixOS has
no such file. **Alpine fails identically and is in the integration matrix**, so this was a
supported platform whose binary could never have run. A static `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build
fixes both: one artifact, measured to report `shall 0.8.0` from `nixos/nix`, `alpine:3.20` and
`ubuntu:24.04` alike, with no source change. That is built.

### The four rulings

1. **Does Shall edit `configuration.nix`?** — **A setting decides.** Shall owns
   `/etc/nixos/shall-packages.nix` completely and regenerates it; whether it also adds the one
   `imports = [ ./shall-packages.nix ];` line to `configuration.nix` is a `preferences.toml` key.

   **The `pacman.conf` precedent cited here does NOT carry over, and believing it did was the
   first of three defects a real NixOS found.** That backend appends one `Include =` line and
   never rewrites the body, which works because `pacman.conf` is line-oriented. Nix is an
   expression language: a line appended after the closing brace lands *outside* the attribute
   set, and nix refuses the entire file —

   ```text
   error: syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting end of file
       7| imports = [ ./shall-packages.nix ];
   ```

   — which breaks the machine's boot configuration rather than Shall. The import is inserted
   *inside* the set instead, in one of two recognised shapes (an existing `imports = [` list, or
   the `{` that opens the body after the argument pattern), and any other shape is refused by
   name. Shall still never parses a hand-edited Nix expression in the sense that matters: it
   makes one bounded textual insert, and every shape it produces is handed to
   `nix-instantiate --parse` in CI.

   **And an absent import is a refusal, not a warning.** Nothing declared reaches the system
   until that line exists, so proceeding would rebuild the machine as it already was and report
   an install.

2. **Does `sync` run `nixos-rebuild switch`?** — **Yes, itself.** Consistent with the standing
   ruling that if a thing is the command's job it happens automatically rather than being
   prompted for. It needs root and takes minutes, which is a cost to state, not a reason to ask.

   **It must be passed `-I nixos-config=`, and the second defect was that it was not.**
   `nixos-rebuild` takes its configuration from `NIX_PATH`, which pins
   `nixos-config=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`, so a bare `nixos-rebuild switch` ignores
   `[nixos] config_dir` entirely. Measured on NixOS 26.05: against a scratch `config_dir` the
   rebuild ran 45.9s, rebuilt the system from the *real* config, exited 0, and Shall reported
   `install 1  Status: SUCCESS` for a package that was never installed. A green transaction over
   an untouched machine is the worst shape a failure takes.

   **The third defect was in how the file is written.** `/etc/nixos` is root-owned and
   `std::fs::write` knows nothing about sudo — `needs_root()` governs the commands the executor
   runs, not a direct filesystem call — so an ordinary `shall sync` died with
   `I/O error: Permission denied (os error 13)`, naming neither the file nor the reason. The
   generated file is staged to a temporary path and moved with the executor now, which is the
   shape `pacman`'s drop-in uses: the privileged step is a command, not a syscall. The rollback
   goes the same way, or it would silently no-op on the one directory it exists to protect.

3. **One name or two?** — **Two.** `nix:` keeps meaning `nix profile` on every host, including
   NixOS; `nixos:` means the system configuration. A NixOS user may legitimately want both — a
   package for every account and a scratch tool for one — and two names is the only spelling that
   can say so. It also keeps a shared config file meaning the same thing on every machine, which
   one name could not: `nix:ripgrep` would silently be a different mechanism per host.

4. **How far does it go?** — **Everything.** Not packages alone: `service:` and `firewall:` are
   `configuration.nix` concerns on NixOS too, and are generated into the same file.

   **Built 2026-08-16, in the round after the prefix landed, and the delay is worth recording.**
   The renderer took `services` and `ports` from its first commit and nothing ever passed it
   any — packages arrive through `Installable`, and a `service:` line does not: it is applied by
   `Dependents` through the `service` backend and a `firewall:` line by `Firewall::apply` through
   an adapter. So the half of the ruling that shipped first was the half whose interface already
   fitted, and the ruling read as built because the renderer's signature said it was.

   What the missing half cost on that OS: `systemctl enable` writes into a tree
   `nixos-rebuild switch` regenerates — including the rebuild Shall itself runs one line later
   for a `nixos:` package — and `ufw` is not on a NixOS box at all, so a machine declaring
   `firewall:22/tcp` failed its whole sync on a missing adapter. Both are attributes now, written
   by one function into one file and applied by one rebuild. **State is declared and a transition
   is performed**: `@status=restarted` still goes to the init, with the enablement trimmed out.
   Rules and reasons: `II.30`'s neighbourhood in `target-state.md`, and **V.191**.

**Also ruled, in passing:** `shall export` gains a `nix` format. It already emits Brewfile,
`requirements.txt`, `package.json` and Aptfile; a NixOS fragment is the same idea and falls out
of the generator this decision creates.

### The coverage bound — written before the code, and then found to be wrong

**What was written here first:** *"no container available is NixOS… `nixos-rebuild switch`
against a real NixOS is argv-checked and not executed. It wants a VM or a real host, and until
one exists that row is inference."* That was recorded in this entry and in two spec files and
treated as settled.

**It was one command away from being false.** `wsl --install --from-file nixos.wsl` imports
NixOS-WSL, and NixOS 26.05 was running here within the hour — with `/etc/NIXOS`,
`/run/current-system`, `nixos-rebuild`, systemd and passwordless sudo. The limitation was the
author's, not the environment's, and writing it down confidently is what stopped the search.

**Driving it found three defects that every hermetic layer had passed** — 11 unit tests, a real
Nix parser over every generated shape, clippy, fmt, and a Linux compile check. The three are
recorded against the rulings above. The one worth naming twice is that the gate existed and
pointed the wrong way: `nix-instantiate --parse` validated the file Shall *generates* while the
defect was in the file Shall *edits* and the command Shall *runs*. It validates both now.

### What remains unproven, and what it would cost

**No container available here is NixOS.** `nixos/nix` is the Nix *package manager* on a minimal
base: measured, it has `/nix/store` and `nix` 2.35.2 and it does **not** have `/etc/NIXOS`,
`/run/current-system`, `nixos-rebuild` or systemd. So:

- the generator's output is proven by hermetic Rust tests;
- **that the output is valid Nix** is proven in `nixos/nix` by `nix-instantiate --parse`, which
  is the risk that matters — Shall would be emitting text in another language, and a file nix
  cannot parse breaks the user's whole system configuration rather than just Shall. Measured
  non-vacuous: a well-formed module parses, and a deliberately unbalanced one is refused with
  `error: syntax error, unexpected '}'`;
- the `nix:` profile path is already driven for real in the `tools` image;
- **`nixos-rebuild switch` against a real NixOS was driven by hand on 2026-08-16** — the sentence
  that used to stand here said it was "argv-checked and not executed… until a real host exists
  that row is inference", and it was one `wsl --install --from-file nixos.wsl` from being false.
  It is not inference; it is four defects, listed above. What remains true is narrower and is the
  row to close: **no automated gate reaches it**, and the configuration driven there carried
  packages only — the services and ports of ruling 4 have never been through a real
  `nixos-rebuild`. The price is a NixOS CI leg, and `proving.rs` holds the receipt.


## J6

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-16. Owner: *"do the durable fix. feature rich and configurable, for
power users."* Built in the same commit.**

**`schedule:` reported nothing to do about a schedule it was about to rewrite** — `J2`'s sibling,
named in `J2`'s own entry and left open there because it looked like three adapters and a design.
It was three adapters and a design.

`@cron=` and `@run=` are not in a schedule's ledger key, so editing when a job runs — or what it
runs — produced the same key, was found in the applied-extras ledger, and was reported as
*nothing to do* by the very sync that re-provisioned it underneath. Provisioning is idempotent, so
the machine always converged; what it could not do was say it had changed anything. `plan` filed
it under *Shall cannot read back* rather than under work.

**`J2`'s fix does not transfer, and that is the useful half of the investigation.** `J2` was closed
by putting the discriminating option into the key (`setting:x@scope=system`). A `setting:`'s scope
makes two genuinely different subjects, so the old key's teardown resets a different value. A
schedule's name **is** its identity at the OS scheduler: `schedule:nightly@cron=old` and
`@cron=new` are one cron entry, so `reconcile` — which runs after the apply phase — would
deprovision by name the entry that phase had just written. Editing a schedule would silently
delete it.

**So the machine is asked.** systemd and launchd keep files, so the comparison is the whole unit
Shall would write against the whole unit on disk — exact, and covering every option those
schedulers can express without anyone maintaining a list. Task Scheduler keeps no file, so both
sides are canonicalised: the declaration from the `/SC` arguments, the machine from the trigger
XML, with the trigger shapes captured from real tasks on a Windows 11 box rather than imagined.
**A shape the reader does not understand is `unverifiable`, never drift** — V.188's rule on a
third store.

**The feature-rich half.** Four options, which are the four settings the three schedulers between
them actually have: `enabled` (provision it and leave it silent), `persistent` (run a firing the
machine was switched off for), `jitter` (spread a fleet around the scheduled moment), `elevated`
(run at the highest privilege the account holds). **No scheduler has all four**, so each
provisioner expresses what it can and **refuses the rest by name**, before it writes anything —
accepting an option and dropping it is the same failure as the cron that was silently widened into
`DAILY`. An option nobody wrote is never refused and never changes what the schedule does, which
is why each arrives as an `Option` rather than as a default. A table test asserts the whole matrix;
its first run found a hole (launchd took `persistent` on an `@reboot` job, which has no calendar
to miss).

**Two defects found on the way, both of the class the read-back was built to expose.** Rendering
the systemd unit once instead of twice showed the `@reboot` shape was produced by *overwriting* the
file the ordinary shape had just written, and the replacement carried no `StandardOutput=` at all
— the one kind of job nobody watches run was writing its output nowhere. Its sibling:
`is_task_active` asked only about the timer, so `remove_task`'s end-state assertion was vacuous for
every boot job. launchd and Windows were checked for the same pair and have neither.

**Not proven:** no read-back has been driven against a live systemd, launchd or Task Scheduler.
Registering a task on Windows needs an elevated shell and the container harness provisions no
schedules. Same row as the NixOS rebuild, named rather than implied. Rule: `II.29`, V.192.

## J7

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-16. Three release questions, three answers in one sitting.**

**The version stays `0.8.0`** (owner: *"v.08 — may as well"*). The entry had grown well past its
title — *"the first published binaries"* — so the title is rewritten to cover what the release
holds rather than the number being moved to excuse it.

**`nixos:` ships in it** (owner: *"ship with nixos"*), which is why the backend ceiling was raised
to nine rather than the backend being held back for a NixOS CI leg it does not have yet. The
unproven row travels with it, stated in `proving.rs`, the README's proving table and V.191.

**There is no `shall doctor`, and there will not be one** (owner: *"if you think there should be
doctor, do it, but i feel like not"*). The handoff item that raised this assumed the command
existed and had lost its NixOS reporting; it does not exist and never shipped. `src/main.rs` names
`doctor` among twelve invented names that are refused with the real one, and `shall check health`
already reports the `nixos` backend correctly. Adding an alias would put a second name on a
command that has one, which is the duplication this rewrite exists to remove.

## J8

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-17, and built in the same commit.** The owner took the
recommendation below as written: a backend may declare that its names are qualified; on one, a
bare name matching exactly one atom resolves and **the plan names the atom**, and a bare name
matching more than one is **refused, listing them**. The rule is [Part II](target-state.md)'s
bare-name section and its reason is **V.193**. `emerge` is the only backend that declares it
today (`qualified_names = true`); the flag is read by `GenericSearchable::qualifies_names`, and
the default is `false`, which is the exact-name rule every other manager wants.

**The lock was the part the recommendation did not say out loud, and it is settled the same
way**: `locks/bare.HOST.toml` freezes which *manager* answered, because that is a choice between
managers; the atom is not a choice and is re-read each run from the one backend that owns it, so
a second sync cannot plan `emerge:jq` off a lock written by the first.

**The question as it was asked, kept because the diagnosis is the reason for the rule:**

**The finding, and it is not the one the failure looks like.** `shall install jq` on Gentoo
answers *"no package manager this line accepts has `jq`"* while `emerge --search jq` is printing
three packages called jq. `Searchable::lookup` — the question the resolver asks — is
`search(name).find(|p| p.name == name)`, and `emerge`'s search parser returns Portage's atoms:
`app-misc/jq`, `dev-python/jq`, `app-emacs/jq-mode`. The string being compared is the one the
user typed, so on that backend the comparison can never be true. Every line that does not spell
the category resolves to no manager at all.

**Why nothing caught it, which is the part worth keeping.** The gentoo leg scored `pass=238
fail=0` for as long as it ran, and those five checks were among the 238. Measured on 2026-08-17
by running the harness against both images and diffing the two runs, the only difference is one
line:

    < READY backends: appimage cargo emerge github link service web
    > READY backends: appimage emerge github link service web

`gentoo/stage3` shipped a Rust toolchain, so the **`cargo` backend was ready on the Gentoo
image** — and `jq` is a crate. The leg named for `emerge` was resolving its canary from
crates.io. The 2026-08-17 change that stopped the image depending on a rolling toolchain removed
the accidental answerer, and the defect it had been covering became visible the same day. This is
the same shape as the guix leg that measured Debian's `apt` because `metacall/guix` is
Debian-based, and it is why a canary must be resolved by the manager the leg is named for.

**The family, enumerated rather than assumed.** Of the twenty search readers in
`parsers::named::search`, exactly one returns a qualified name: `ecosystem::emerge_search`.
`pacman::parse_search_for` takes the other road and strips the repository — `core/bash` is read
as `bash` — and the rest print bare names. So this is one backend, and the question is which of
those two roads is right rather than how many callers to patch.

**Stripping the category, pacman-style, is the wrong road here, and the reason is specific.**
Portage refuses a bare `emerge jq` itself, as ambiguous between `app-misc/jq` and `dev-python/jq`
— so a stripped name would resolve and then fail at the manager. Worse, `emerge`'s *installed*
listing is `qlist -I`, which prints atoms and is not going to stop: a declaration reading `jq`
against an installed `app-misc/jq` never matches, so every sync would re-install a package that
is already there.

**Recommendation.** A manager may declare that its names are qualified. On one, a bare name that
matches exactly **one** atom resolves to it and the plan names the atom, so what reaches Portage
and what comes back from `qlist -I` are the same string; a bare name matching more than one is
**refused, listing them** — which is what Portage does, and it is a better answer than picking
the first. The owner decides; this is not built.

**The gentoo leg was held red rather than made green by editing the canary to `app-misc/jq`**,
on the precedent `lvm:`'s `@size` set — that leg failed by name every run until `Q18` ruled the
table wrong. It is green now because the product resolves the name, not because the check stopped
asking.

## J9

**Status: ANSWERED — ruled 2026-08-17, and built in the same commit.** The owner agreed to the
recommendation as put: **the line names the flag the run actually passed, and the refusal names
both flags for the one ceiling either of them answers.** No run's outcome changes — the same
commands proceed and the same commands are refused — only the words do.

**Two guard messages named `--allow-mass-removal` whatever the caller typed.** `max_total_changes`
counts everything one command does, so **either** mass flag answers it (`N8`), and both surfaces
that talk about it were written as though only one existed.

| | what a run of `sync --allow-mass-install` saw | what is wrong with it |
|---|---|---|
| after the fact | `the removal count for 'sync' was allowed by --allow-mass-removal.` | names a flag the caller never passed, a ceiling it did not clear, and a *removal* on a run that removed nothing |
| while blocked | `<command> --allow-mass-removal carry out this run anyway` | the only way out it offers is a removal flag, on a run whose changes are installs |

The second is the expensive one. An announcement is read afterwards and confuses; a refusal's
*What to do* block is read by someone who is stopped, and this one told them that the way to get
their installs through was to authorize mass deletion. Some fraction of people stop there.

**Both halves came from the wrong place, and one of them already had a rule against it.**
`counted_as` exists precisely so a sentence and the `[guard]` key it names cannot describe
different things, and its own doc says so — but `announcement` took its noun from the *caller*
and its flag from a literal. It now reads the ceiling off each objection's `setting` and the
flags off the config, so the two things a reader acts on are both facts of the run:

```text
'sync' makes 62 changes in total, over the limit of 50 ([guard] max_total_changes) — allowed by --allow-mass-install.
```

The count clause is spelled the way the *refusal* spells the same fact, so one ceiling reads
identically whether it stopped the run or was waved through; two clauses join with `; ` when a
per-kind ceiling and the total were cleared together.

**Both flags are named when both were passed**, rather than one being attributed. Deciding which
was load-bearing is not answerable for the one ceiling either answers: either one of them was.

**Two other surfaces were already right, and that is what settles the direction.** `shall
protected`'s help has printed *"Either flag answers `max_total_changes`; neither answers a
protected name"* since the ceiling shipped, and the README says *"either answers the total — a
total is made of both"*. The guard's own two messages were the only places contradicting the
documentation of the thing they implement, so this is not a new rule being chosen — it is two
surfaces being made to say what the other two already said. **Where one surface already states
the rule, the others are wrong rather than different**, and finding the sibling that reads
correctly is worth doing before treating a discrepancy as an open design question.

**What was checked and deliberately left alone.**

- **The per-kind refusals** — `max_removals`, `max_extra_removals`, `max_port_closures` — keep
  offering `--allow-mass-removal` alone. Those ceilings answer to that flag and no other (`Y20`),
  so adding the install flag there would print advice that does not work.
- **The install ceiling's own line** (`the install count for 'sync' (62) was allowed by
  --allow-mass-install.`) is correct as written: `max_installs` answers to one flag, and that
  flag is the condition on the branch that prints it, so it cannot name one the caller did not
  pass.
- **`shall protected`'s help** already states the rule and needed no change.

## L1

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-18, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**L1 - Does `record_success` flush per package, or once per wave?** Every `record_start` /
`record_success` / `record_failure` was one physical `sync_data`, under the journal mutex, on a
runtime worker. The *opening* half was already batched - `record_starts` writes a whole wave's
entries and flushes once, which gives every entry the same guarantee at one flush instead of *k*,
and is free. The closing half is a durability trade rather than a rewrite of the same one.

**Ruled: make it the user's choice, and batch by default.** The owner's reasoning went past the
recommendation: *"a lot of this could be gotten back from the disk next time, so batching makes
more sense."* That is the stronger argument. A lost completion is not lost information - the next
`list` asks the manager and gets the truth back, and a crash in the window between "installed" and
"recorded as installed" costs one idempotent re-run, which `app/sync/mod.rs` already relies on for
recovery. On a 298-package config the alternative is ~298 physical flushes on the critical path,
each stalling the whole wave, to close a window whose cost is a repeated install.

**One setting, not two.** `[journal] flush_every`, an integer, default 32, with `1` meaning flush
every completion. A `flush = "each" | "batch"` mode beside a `batch_size` would have been two
knobs whose combinations need a precedence rule, and `batch_size = 1` already *is* per-package
flushing - the repo's own "two of everything is how this got into trouble" applies to settings.
Zero reads as one: "never flush" is the single answer the buffer must not be able to express, and
the clamp lives on the journal rather than on the settings struct, beside the buffer it bounds.

**What ships with it.** The buffer is invisible inside the process - the in-memory entry changes
immediately, so `needs_recovery` and `heal` are never behind. Opening a wave flushes the previous
wave's completions, so a batch never straddles a wave and the file read forward is the run in the
order it happened. `Drop` flushes, so a clean exit loses nothing and only a kill does. A rewrite
(`cleanup`) clears the buffer, because the transitions it is about are already in the entries it
writes from. `journalled` now opens its actions with `record_starts` rather than a loop of
`record_start`, which was *k* flushes for *k* actions - the one caller the earlier round missed.

## L2

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-18, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**L2 - Are the `locks/` ledgers protected by the data lock, by writer scope, or by nothing?**
`DataLock` guards `safe_data_dir()`. The six ledgers `core::ledger::LockFile` governs - the regex
expansions, the bare-name resolutions, the exec run counts, the hook approvals, the artifact
selections, the applied extras - live under `config_root/locks`. Two different trees, and the lock
covers one of them.

**The recommendation this entry carried was wrong, and the premise under it was wrong.** It
proposed recording the status quo as the rule; when the owner ruled *"fix it in the most robust
way - that is the shape of the codebase"*, the obvious reading was to move `locks/` under the data
directory. **That would remove a feature.** `target-state.md` is explicit: *"`locks/` - generated.
In git. Yours."* It travels with the config to every machine that shares it, which is the entire
reason `bare.HOST.toml` is per host. Relocating it would turn a committed, shareable record into
machine-local bookkeeping in order to close a race.

**And the spec had already ruled it, in a sentence nobody had checked against the code.** V.61:
*"The lock is on the data directory rather than the file because ... the journal and the `locks/`
ledgers move with it, and a lock that covers one of a set that must agree is the same as no
lock."* The ledgers are not in that directory and never were.

**Ruled and built: the ledgers stay where they are, and the read-modify-write becomes one step.**
`LockFile::update` holds one data lock across the load, the change and the save. A lock around the
*save* alone would close nothing - the copy being written was read before the lock was taken - and
a whole-file copy carries another process's entries as absences, which is how they are lost.

**Whether the lock is held is asked at runtime, not carried by a type.** `Deferred` takes the lock
and releases it repeatedly, so a token proving "the lock is held" would be true when it was made
and false when it was read. The process counts its own holds, and `update` takes the lock only
when nothing already has it - which is also what stops it waiting for itself, since `flock` is per
open file description and a second handle in a holding process blocks for ever.

**What the audit of this found, which is the part worth keeping.** Every ledger write in the tree
today is reached from a `Writer` verb, and a `Writer` holds the lock for its whole run - so the
code was already correct, by exactly the accident this entry names. What it could not do was stay
correct. Six pure-insert approvers moved to `update`; the remaining eleven writes are named in
`a_ledger_is_read_and_written_as_one_step_tests` with the sentence that says why each is safe, and
a twelfth cannot be added without writing one. **The regex lock was what the accident looks like
when half of it is missing** - it had no `may_record_locks` gate, so `shall check`, a `Reader`,
wrote `locks/regex.toml` for real under no lock at all.

## L3

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-18, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**L3 - Do reader commands accept a torn cross-file view?** `LockScope::Reader` never takes the
data lock, so a reader reads `registry.json`, `journal.jsonl` and the `locks/` ledgers as separate,
unsynchronised operations while a writer in another process updates all three. Each individual
file is safe - the registry is written by atomic rename and the journal's torn-tail-drop is
deliberate - but the exposure is *between* them.

**Ruled: fix it. The recommendation to rule it and leave it was declined.** The owner asked the
right question first - *"are there downsides to making it robust?"* - and there is one, which is
why the obvious fix is not the one that shipped. **Readers must not take the lock.** A `sync`
holds it for as long as the package managers take, which is minutes; a `list` that queued behind
it would be a program that stops answering questions exactly when there is most to ask about. That
trade was made once already, with `watch`, and it ended with the user who followed the documented
deployment unable to run any other Shall on the machine (V.194).

**So a reader detects a writer instead of excluding one.** `core::stable` notes the writer
generation, runs the read, and notes it again; an unchanged count with no holder at either end
means the read spanned one moment. The counter is bumped by a writer **on release**, so a reader
that sees no writer and no change is reading strictly after that writer rather than during it.
On a quiet machine - no writer at all, which is nearly every run - the whole mechanism is two
reads of two tiny files and no waiting of any kind, so the answer to *"are there downsides"* is:
none a user can measure, once the design stops being "take the lock".

**It is a detector and not a proof.** After `stable::ATTEMPTS` tries it returns the last answer
rather than an error: a machine where a writer commits during every attempt is a machine where the
answer is stale by the time it is printed whatever anyone does, and advisory output that refuses
to print is worse than output a moment behind.

**Applied at the registry/journal pair**, which every command loads at context build and which is
therefore every reader's exposure, not only the three-source ones.

## L4

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-18, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**L4 - Part II describes a locking model the code deliberately no longer has.** Raised rather than
changed, because `CLAUDE.md` says *"Anything where Part II looks wrong. **Do not fix Part II
yourself.**"*

`target-state.md` II.8 stated: *"Every command that mutates state takes an exclusive lock on the
data directory **for its whole run**, and a second one waits or says who holds it."* The code has
had three lock scopes since `LockScope` was introduced, and the change was correct and well
argued: `Writer` holds it for the run; **`Deferred` does not**, because `watch` is an unbounded
loop meant to be left running, and held for the run it disabled `install`, `sync` and the
`hook-reconcile` a hand-typed `apt install` fires for as long as the daemon was up - *"the user who
followed the documented deployment bricked their own CLI."* `Reader` takes no lock at all.

**Ruled: the docs match the code.** The direction matters and is recorded here explicitly - **the
documentation changed and the locking code did not.** II.8 now carries the three-scope table with
`Deferred`'s justification and the reason `Reader` takes nothing; II.24 was the sibling that still
described `Commands::writes()` as the exhaustive match, when it is now derived from
`lock_scope()`; V.194 is the new why entry, and V.195 and V.196 are L3's and L2's.

**And V.61 was corrected rather than left standing.** Its closing paragraph claimed the lock
covers the `locks/` ledgers. It does not and never did - see L2 - and a spec that is *more*
protective than the code is the direction that hides findings rather than raising false ones.

**A bookkeeping defect found on the way.** Two separate entries were both numbered **V.192** - the
schedules one and the Portage one - and both are cited from `target-state.md`, so every reference
to V.192 pointed at either. The Portage entry is now V.193 and its citations follow it.

## M1

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-21, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**M1 — An upstream ecosystem broke. Whose problem is that, and what absorbs it?** On 2026-08-21
Hackage published root.json version 8, whose root role takes three signatures from six keys that
the cabal-install Ubuntu 24.04 ships — 3.8.1.0, and no HTTPS transport either — does not have.
`cabal update` answered `<repo>/root.json does not have enough signatures signed with the
appropriate keys`, the `tools` image shipped with no Hackage index, and forty minutes into the
nightly `cabal install hello` failed. The harness scored it `defect`, correctly by its own rules,
and the terminator probe went red behind it because no cabal verb could resolve an operand.

**The first answer written down was that this was ecosystem variance and the image's problem.**
The owner's tayneh killed it in one line: *if Shall can't deal with ecosystem drift, it's a Shall
problem.* And the measurement was worse than the one backend — **16 of 23 declarative backends
had no `ExitPolicy` at all**, so every failure any of them ever produced classified as `unknown`,
which is Shall saying *nobody looked*. The harness was not guessing wrong; it was the only thing
in the chain still willing to have an opinion.

**Ruled, in three parts.**

1. **A failure Shall cannot name is a defect in Shall, not variance in the ecosystem.** A
   repository or index that cannot be verified or reached classifies **transient**, so
   `falsify_transience` retries it, gets the same answer and reports `Exhausted` — somebody
   tested the claim and it did not clear. `Permanent` would promise the package can never
   install, which is false the moment the trust anchor is repaired.
2. **An excuse has an expiry date.** The harnesses may excuse an unmeasurable lifecycle only
   against a dated `drift <host-class> <backend> <YYYY-MM-DD>` line in
   `scripts/lifecycle-floor.txt`, and only for fourteen days. Unregistered or expired, the
   backend does not count toward the floor. The rate-limit window this excuse was built for
   clears itself in twenty minutes; a rotated root key never does, and excused-but-never-aged is
   `|| true` with better manners.
3. **Marker sets come from running the manager, not from reading its docs.** Ten backends
   gained a policy on the day and nine of them an absent marker, taking absent-name coverage
   from 12 to 20 of the 49 a Windows build registers. Every phrasing was captured from the
   manager itself, three ways: online against a name that does not exist, under
   `--network none`, and against a package that DOES exist at an impossible version.

**A third pass was added mid-flight, and it overturned part of the second.** `mix` answers from
a stale cache when Hex is unreachable, in identical words, with only `Failed to fetch record`
above it to say so. `dart pub` refuses a hyphenated name before it asks pub.dev at all, so the
capture first taken for it was a fact about the string. And `luarocks` — which sat on the
cannot-report list as a *decision*, with a note asking for exactly the offline measurement — was
given an absent marker on the strength of that measurement and then had it taken straight back
out, because a real rock at an impossible version prints the same summary with no warning above
it. The register now records the general form: **a name, an index and a version are three things
an install resolves, and a marker is only safe once all three have been asked.**

**Addendum, later the same day: the sweep was scoped to the wrong thing, and finishing it found
a shipped bug.** The probe list came from `builtin_backends.toml` — the *declarative* backends,
one table of two — so every Rust-implemented backend was invisible to it, six of them sitting in
the image already built. Completing it from the registry instead took absent-name coverage from
12 to **25 of 49**: `pip`, `bun`, `dotnet`, `mise` and `nix` joined, and `conda` earned a written
reason to stay out — one sentence for two facts, like `luarocks`.

And it found that **`pipx`'s marker had been wrong since `N-1`**. `no matching distribution found
for` is what pip says about a bad VERSION as well as a bad name, so `pipx:black@version=99.99.99`
withdrew the declaration for a real package. `(from versions: none)` is the discriminator, and
`pip` inherits both the bug and the fix. The fixture that should have caught it was a one-line
capture trimmed to the line being asserted on.

A last one came off real hardware rather than a container. On a NixOS-WSL box a
`nixos-rebuild switch` builds the system and then cannot activate it — no session bus, which is
true of every NixOS-WSL install and every container — and Shall answered `unknown` to the one
failure that machine reliably produces. `nixos` now classes it `Permanent`, because it is a fact
about the environment and no retry changes it. The same run confirmed the rollback path on a
real machine: `shall-packages.nix` and `configuration.nix` went back byte-identical, and the
system rebuilt to the same store path as the control taken before any of it ran.

**And the image, which is still repaired, for a different reason than the one first given.** Not
*not our bug* — a test rig whose cabal cannot reach Hackage measures nothing. It seeds Hackage's
current root as the local trust anchor before `cabal update`, fetched per build so the next
rotation is a no-op, and the three index steps that were `|| true` no longer are. That silence
is what let an image ship broken and report it as a backend defect forty minutes later.

## M2

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-21, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**M2 — A drifted ecosystem stopped the whole sync. Should it?** `M1` fixed the half of this that
lives in CI. The half that lives on a user's machine is worse: `TransactionConfig::patient()` set
`continue_on_error: false`, so the first failed node ended the transaction and everything the
planner had not yet dispatched was never attempted. One `cabal:` line among two hundred
declarations, a signing key rotated in a registry the user does not control, and the machine
stops converging — for everything, not just for Haskell. The way out was `--keep-going`, a flag
you have to already know exists.

**`Y15` is this ruling's own argument, one category short.** That entry (2026-08-06) came from
`spec_is_missing` raising `BackendNotFound` inside the planner's fan-out, so one `apt:` line
dropped the twenty `winget:` lines beside it. It ruled: *that is a portable config, not a broken
one* — skipped, reported, and the command succeeds; a package that genuinely fails still fails,
with `--keep-going` as the per-run opt-in. It drew that line with two categories available,
because in August every failure of the third kind arrived as `Retryability::Unknown` and there
was nothing to key on. `M1` is what created the third: a rotated registry key or an index that
will not verify is neither the config's fault nor fixable by editing the line.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-21): a key, configurable, with a sane default.** `[sync]
continue_past_transient`, **on**. A failure Shall itself classified `Transient` or `Exhausted`
no longer ends the run: the rest of the plan is attempted, what failed is named, and the command
still exits non-zero. On by default because converging the machine IS what `sync` is for, and a
flag the user has to already know about is that job half done.

**Why this may have a file form when `--keep-going` deliberately may not.** The flag's own doc
says a machine-wide setting that silently downgrades every future failure to a warning is the
destructive default nobody typed, and that is still true — it is just not what this is. Nothing
is downgraded: the exit code is unchanged, the summary names what failed, and the only thing
decided here is whether the declarations *behind* the failed one are attempted before the run
fails. `G1` already settled that continuing is not succeeding.

**What keeps it from becoming `--keep-going` for everybody.** The mode reads the classification,
not merely its own name. `Permanent`, `Refused` and `Unknown` all still end the run — `Permanent`
says the request is wrong and you want to know before more of the plan runs on it, and `Unknown`
means nobody looked, which is not a licence to continue. A round of failures carries on only if
**every** failure in it was classified passing, so one `Permanent` among the transients stops the
transaction. That cell has its own test, and without it the mode would be a rename.

**Three things that did NOT change, each for a stated reason.** The flag outranks the key rather
than combining with it — somebody at a keyboard said `--keep-going`, and the key is what the
machine does when nobody said. Batching stays at `MAX_BATCH` under the new mode, because `G1`'s
argument for one-package-per-command is about a bad NAME, which is a fact about one member of a
batch, while the failures this mode carries on past are facts about the MANAGER and true of every
member equally. And `TransactionConfig::patient()` — the library default that recovery and every
hand-built transaction start from — stays all-or-nothing; only `from_config` reads the key.

## M3

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-21, owner ruling, built in the same commit.**

**M3 — `M2` wrote its own limitation down. Should the limitation stand?** Packages heading for
one manager in one wave share a command line (II.19), and a manager fails a command line as a
unit — so `M2` rescued every OTHER manager's packages and none of the failed batch's own. The
first test written for `M2` proved it by failing: two packages on one mock manager, one command
line, and the good one went down with the doomed one. It was pinned as a documented cost.

**RULED (owner, 2026-08-21): fix it, configurable, modular, sane default.** `[sync]
batch_recovery`, a kind rather than a switch because the strategies differ in cost by an order
of magnitude:

- **`bisect` (default)** — halve the failed batch, ask about each half, recurse only into a half
  that failed.
- **`off`** — one command, as before.
- **`every`** — one command per member, whatever the halves would have said.

**The number that chose bisection over splitting flat** is on `execute_batch_with_retry` and was
measured on Ubuntu: `apt install <8 packages>` as one command is **3,161 ms**, and those same
eight one at a time are **31,901 ms**. Ten times, and superlinear — each invocation re-reads the
cache, re-takes the dpkg lock and re-resolves a graph the batch resolves once. Splitting flat
throws that amortisation away; bisection keeps it, because every question it asks is still a
batch.

**The stopping rule is the part worth reading.** One bad member can only be in ONE half, so two
halves that both fail is not a member — it is the manager, its index or its lock, and every
further question gets the same answer. Narrowing stops dead there. That is the case `M2` is
named after: a rotated signing key fails every package equally, and it now costs **two** extra
commands rather than thirty. Measured as a command log in
`two_failing_halves_is_the_manager_and_narrowing_stops_dead`.

**Where it does not fire, and why each is deliberate.** Not on a `Permanent` failure — the
transaction is ending over it, so the pieces would be asked and thrown away. Not when the run is
configured all-or-nothing — that owner asked for a plan that either lands or does not, and
narrowing would install the good members anyway. And not under `--keep-going`, which `G1`
already caps at one package per command, so there is never a batch to narrow.

**What it cost to build.** The retry loop moved out of `execute_batch_with_retry` into
`run_one_command`, so a narrowing can re-ask the manager without re-opening a WAL entry or
firing `before_install` twice — a narrowing is a retry with a shorter command line, and a retry
never did either. The journal writes, the `after_install` hooks and the `TaskResult`s were three
copies of the same block on three exits from that function; they are one block over one vector
of per-member verdicts now, which is what made per-member answers expressible at all.

## M4

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-21, owner delegated the call, built in the same commit.**

**M4 — `--keep-going` over a refusal reports it as a failure, not as a refusal. Should it?**

`U21` gave this program an exit vocabulary so a script can tell the three apart: 1 is a failure,
2 is "there are differences", **3 is "Shall refused"**. A script that retries on 1 must not retry
a 3, because a refusal is a decision and it will be made again.

`--keep-going` carries a run past any failure, refusals included — that part is what the flag is
for and is not in question. What is in question is the exit code afterwards. The run ends by
raising a *summary* of what it carried past, and a summary is a `CommandFailed`, so:

| the same refused declaration | exit |
|---|---|
| `shall sync` | **3** (`Error::Refused`) |
| `shall sync --keep-going` | **1** (the summary) |

**Measured**, not argued: a `web:` line over plain HTTP under `--keep-going` printed
`shall-failure-class: permanent`, and printing that line at all is the proof — `print_failure_class`
sits on the arm *after* the refusal arm has returned, so a run reaching it was not treated as a
refusal.

**This is the same shape as `VI.11`** — an aggregate that loses a property of its members — and it
was found by fixing that one. It is recorded rather than fixed because it changes an exit code,
which is behaviour a user notices, and this repo's rule is that such a change is the owner's.

**RULED (owner delegated, 2026-08-21): fix it, on the "every member" test.** When *every*
operation a run carried past was refused, the summary is `Error::Refused` and the exit stays 3.
One member that genuinely failed and it stays 1 — something did fail, and reporting that run as a
refusal would hide it behind the refusal. The rule is `II.60` and its reason is `V.199`, both of
which it shares with `VI.11`: this is the same defect one field over, an aggregate dropping a
property of its members, and it is now one function (`summarise`) that `sync` and `heal` both go
through.

**The frequency is small and the effect is total.** A fleet script that retries exit 1 will retry
a refusal for ever, and `B1` names `--keep-going` as the flag fleet rollouts use.

**Pinned as a comparison, not a constant** — `keeping_going_past_a_refusal_still_reports_a_refusal`
asserts the flagged and unflagged runs exit the same, and self-checks that the probe is still
being refused at all, since a probe that stopped being a refusal would leave the test comparing
two ordinary failures.

## M5

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-23, delegated ruling (audit fix shapes approved by the owner), built in the same commit.**

**M5 — a failed OS-essential query disarms the rail for the whole run. Should it refuse instead?**

The 2026-08-23 audit found `essential_names` turning a failed query into an empty set, which to
the guard reads exactly like "nothing here is essential". One manager having a bad day therefore
silently removed the OS-essential protection from every removal in the run — `purge-undeclared`
included, the command that sweeps widest exactly when nobody is reading its list. The rail's own
comment said so: *"a backend that cannot answer contributes nothing and never blocks the guard."*

**RULED (delegated, 2026-08-23): fail closed, scoped to exactly the blind spot.** A manager that
is here and whose essential query fails has its removals refused for that run
(`Objection::UnverifiedEssentials`) — protection-class: no mass flag clears it, and `--yes`
never could. A backend not on this machine stays out of scope (II.7c): nothing here went through
it, so there is no question to ask. Leases, rebuild narrowing, rollback compensation and
`shall protected` all answer from the same query, so an inspector cannot report clean over an
enforcer that would refuse.

The rule is II.10's table (the OS-essential row now says so) and the reason is V.200.




## R1

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-23, delegated (audit fix shapes approved by the owner), built same commit.**

**R1 — the guard asks twice over one shared budget: who spends?**

`remove-orphans` and `purge-undeclared` asked the guard's question before their confirmation
prompt through `enforce`/`enforce_deliberate`, which record into the ledger on success. The
engine asked again over the same pairs through the same `Arc`, measured `N + N` against the
ceiling, and refused a set the user had already confirmed — eleven orphans passed the prompt,
refused 22/20 after it.

**RESOLVED:** two asks, one rule, one spend. The decision lives in `guard::vet` /
`guard::vet_deliberate` — refuse or permit, record nothing. `enforce_kind` and
`enforce_deliberate` are vet + record. A reader can hold both facts in one sentence, which is
the test the old arrangement failed.

The rule is II.10 ("Two asks, one spend") and the reason is V.201.


## R2

**R2 — an `@undo=` is a shell command nothing can inspect. Is it outside invariant 2?**

It was: no ceiling, no flag, no consultation — a config dropping forty `exec:` lines ran forty
arbitrary teardowns past every gate.

**RESOLVED:** charged, not exempt. `guard::charge_unmodelled` answers the batch to
`max_total_changes` as one charge before the first command runs, then records it;
`--allow-mass-removal` clears a refusal as for any other family. Protected-name consultation
does not apply and that limit is stated where it was decided: there is no name to match in an
opaque command. Test: `a_batch_of_unmodelled_mutations_answers_the_total_ceiling`.

The rule is II.10 ("Mutations the model cannot name are charged").


## R3

**Status: ANSWERED — 2026-08-23, delegated, built same commit.**

**R3 — what does a transaction killed part-way owe the truth?**

Three lies at once: the WAL entries of aborted batches closed as Failed (Q33 says Failed means an
outcome was reached, so heal walked past installs that may have half-run); purge reported
all-or-nothing from a binary Result; a failed purge exited 0.

**RESOLVED:** completed removals that stayed removed are counted onto the engine's metrics via
`Transaction::executed_removals`; their entries close as Abandoned; cleanup commands report
"removed X / remain installed" from those counters; a failed purge exits non-zero. Tests:
the rewritten batching trio plus `executed_removals_tests`.

The rules are II.10 ("A failed run reports what it did") and V.202.


## R4

**Status: ANSWERED — owner ruling 2026-08-23, built 2026-08-24.**

**R4 — where does unattended bootstrap consent live?**

`-y` answered the bootstrap confirmation, so `--yes sync` executed vendor installer scripts
(`curl | sh`) under a header promising "Ask, then do", and scheduled syncs inherited it.

**RULED:** `--yes` never answers the bootstrap prompt by itself. The consent that does lives in
preferences.toml — `[config] bootstrap_auto_yes = true`, default off — written by a human beside
the repo it trusts. Built in `app/apply/bootstrap.rs`; the warning names the setting when it
fires.


## R5

**Status: ANSWERED — owner ruling 2026-08-23, built 2026-08-24.**

**R5 — non-interactive `apply`: apply or refuse?**

With neither `--yes` nor a terminal, `sync` refused and `apply` fell through its review and
applied. Opposite postures in the two most destructive commands.

**RULED:** apply refuses like sync — same sentence shape, `--yes` answers it, exit 3.
Built in `verbs/plan.rs`.


## R6

**Status: ANSWERED 2026-08-24, both halves built.** The owner ruled the substance —
config-selectable strictness for the exec gate, pins honored everywhere with only explicit
unpin commands escaping.

**The permission gate:** `[exec] trust` in `preferences.toml` selects which write bits
disqualify a script the config names before its bytes are hashed or run — `owner-only`,
`not-world-writable` (the default: it closes the file-drop hole while accepting the umask
most real checkouts have), or `warn`. The gate sits in the one resolution the preview and the
run share, refuses as `Error::Refused` (exit 3), and on platforms with no mode word the same
enforcement point runs and accepts. Rule `II.61`, rationale `V.204`.

**Pins past install:** the audit's complaint was that `version_pin` was consumed only in
`install_group`. Verified against the tree before building: the planner already plans a
drifted pin back down (`spec_is_missing` compares installed against `@version=`), and a
targeted upgrade re-resolves the line so its pin rides along — the one surface that floated a
typed decision was the native whole-system upgrade, which hands each manager its own
upgrade-all. It now refuses while a manifest-typed pin exists on a manager that runs here,
names the pins, and takes `--ignore-pins` as the explicit escape — the same answer B9 gave
holds, because it is the same finding one row down the table. The gate reads only
declarations: its resolver runs with `.upgrading()`, so lockfile records never masquerade as
pins. Rule `II.62`, rationale `V.205`.
