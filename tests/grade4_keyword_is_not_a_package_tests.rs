//! GRADER round 5, 2026-07-30 — RED. A grammar keyword written on a line by itself is read as a
//! package name, resolved against a real package index, and queued for install.
//!
//! Measured end to end, release binary, a module containing the single word `link` — which is
//! what a half-typed `link:SRC @target=DEST` line looks like:
//!
//!     $ shall eval
//!       "present": [ { "backend": "cargo", "name": "link", "source": "modules/kw.txt:1" } ]
//!     $ shall --dry-run sync -y
//!       install 1   remove 0   (total 1 change(s))     backends: cargo
//!     $ shall check
//!       ->  drift   1 to install …  run `shall sync`
//!
//! Thirteen of fourteen keywords behave this way and each resolves to a real backend holding a
//! real package of that name — the resolver searched live indexes to produce these:
//!
//!     when -> cargo:when      absent -> pip:absent    link  -> cargo:link    service -> cargo:service
//!     setting -> cargo:setting  shim -> scoop:shim    schedule -> cargo:schedule  repo -> cargo:repo
//!     if -> gem:if            else -> npm:else        end -> cargo:end       import -> gem:import
//!     include -> cargo:include                        use  -> refused (the only one)
//!
//! **This is not a broken parser.** A package name is one bare word (II.2), so a bare keyword is a
//! grammatically valid package line. Written with their punctuation the same words refuse
//! correctly and legibly — `link:`, `service:`, `shim:`, `when linux`, `when linux {` all exit 1
//! with a located `Configuration error`. The ambiguity is confined to the bare word, and what to
//! do about it — reserve them, warn on them, require a backend prefix on a colliding name — is a
//! language decision that belongs in `decisions.md`.
//!
//! The test is written at the grammar rather than through the binary on purpose: resolving one of
//! these costs 10–27 seconds, because a bare name has no backend and the resolver asks every
//! manager in priority order. The same fixture with `cargo:ripgrep` takes 0.2s.
//!
//! The keyword list is read from `known_prefixes()` rather than copied, so a prefix added later
//! is covered without anyone remembering to add it here.
