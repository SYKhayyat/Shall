//! `--dry-run` performs nothing, checked over **every** subcommand rather than the ones that
//! had a bug report.
//!
//! The history this exists to end: the flag was consulted per verb, so the question was never
//! "is `uninstall` fixed" but "which verbs remembered". Round 1 fixed `uninstall`, `unmanage`,
//! `module create` and `schedule add`. Round 2's audit then found `activate`, `deactivate`,
//! `lock`, `git init` and `config init` still acting — and it had probed 13 of 61 subcommands,
//! so the honest reading of that result was "at least five", never "exactly five".
//!
//! Two properties, and the second is what makes the first worth anything:
//!
//! 1. **Byte-identical.** Snapshot the config directory, run under `--dry-run`, snapshot again,
//!    and require the two to match exactly.
//! 2. **A control that proves the case could have failed.** The same command without the flag
//!    must change the directory. Without this, a case whose fixture made the command a no-op
//!    passes while proving nothing — which is exactly how the grader's first draft scored
//!    `activate` as passing, on a fixture where the profile was already active.
//!
//! And a third, about coverage rather than behaviour: **every subcommand `--help` lists is
//! either exercised here or exempted with a reason, and every exemption names a subcommand
//! that exists.** E29 was a stale exemption for `undo`, a command that had been renamed away;
//! an exemption list nothing validates is a list that grows quietly.
//!
//! **The blind spot this file had, and what it cost.** Both snapshots walked the *config*
//! directory, and three exemptions said so out loud: `hold`, `unhold` and `heal` were excused
//! because "holds live in the data dir, not the config dir". The data directory holds
//! `registry.json` — the managed set, the file that decides whether the next `sync` *removes* a
//! package. So `--dry-run adopt` recorded 112 packages as managed while correctly not writing
//! the manifest that declares them, which is the one state the model reads as *the user deleted
//! every line*; `shall check` then said `112 to remove … run shall sync`, and it did. The gate
//! that says "every subcommand" could not have seen it: an exemption naming the instrument's
//! blind spot is not a reason, it is the finding. Both snapshots now walk the whole fixture —
//! config, data and the working directory — and the three excused verbs are driven.

/// was no control — and ruled it with `bundle` on the reasoning rather than on a measurement.
/// The measurement says `export` **already honours the flag**: it prints `[DRY-RUN] would write
/// <path>` per manifest and writes none of them. So this test is a regression guard, not a fix,
/// and B43's code change is `bundle` alone.
///
/// It is here rather than in `CASES` because a host with no packages to export makes the
/// control write nothing, which the table correctly reads as a broken fixture. Such a host is
/// **skipped and named**, the same way the table skips `adopt`.
