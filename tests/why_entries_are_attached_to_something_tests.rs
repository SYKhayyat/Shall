//! `why.md` is a mandatory gate, and half of it was rationale for nothing.
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md` states the rule: *"Every rule in `spec/target-state.md` has a matching entry in
//! `spec/why.md` explaining the bug it exists to prevent; do not change a target-state rule
//! without reading its why entry first."* That makes `why.md` the only document in this repo a
//! contributor is **required** to read before touching Part II.
//!
//! Measured on 2026-08-07: **155 `V.n` entries, 77 cited by a Part II rule, 46 cited from `src/`
//! or `tests/`, and 53 cited by nothing at all.** A third of a mandatory gate explains no rule
//! and enforces no check. That is not a size problem — it is the same drift the register's own
//! index had, in the file whose job is to stop drift.
//!
//! Two questions, and they are not the same question.
//!
//! **Does every citation resolve?** This is the one that protects `CLAUDE.md`'s rule. A Part II
//! rule ending `**V.141.**` sends the reader to an entry that has to be there, or the mandatory
//! read is a dead link and the rule can be changed with its reason unread. It passes today at
//! zero failures in *both* directions — Part II and the code — and it is a hard assertion for
//! that reason: it costs nothing until someone renumbers an entry.
//!
//! **Is every entry attached to something?** A ratchet, not an assertion, because the answer was
//! 53 on 2026-09-30 and the resolution is work rather than a typo. An uncited entry has three honest
//! ends: cite it from the rule it explains, move it to the doc comment of the test that enforces
//! it — a rationale attached to a check cannot go stale, which is the best pattern in this
//! corpus — or, if it explains nothing that still exists, it is the owner's to retire.
//!
//! **`UNCITED_CEILING` may only go down.** Nothing here deletes prose; the gate is that the pile
//! of unattached rationale cannot grow while nobody is looking, which is exactly how it got to 53.
