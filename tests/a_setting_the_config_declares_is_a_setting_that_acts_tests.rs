//! A knob the configuration offers must be read by something.
//!
//! `SandboxSettings::require_bwrap` is declared, documented — *"On Linux, if true, Shall will
//! fail if 'bwrap' is missing"* — defaulted, serialised, and **read nowhere**. Setting it does
//! nothing at all.
//!
//! Its Windows twin is wired. `windows_require_sandbox` is checked at `sandbox.rs` and
//! produces a refusal in exactly the words its doc promises. The Linux one — the one that
//! governs the default host for this program, and the platform where `bwrap` is the only real
//! mechanism — was never connected.
//!
//! **What it costs is not a dead field.** `require_bwrap` exists to prevent precisely the
//! failure recorded as F10 in `docs/GRADE-2026-08-13.md`: `@sandbox` requested, no `bwrap` on
//! the host, `fallback_allowed` defaulting to `true`, and the command running unconfined with
//! nothing said above `debug!`. A Linux administrator who reads the configuration reference,
//! decides that is unacceptable on their fleet, and writes `require_bwrap = true` has taken the
//! documented step to prevent it — and gets the identical unconfined execution. The knob whose
//! whole purpose is to close the hole is the one that does not exist.
//!
//! **Scope: the family, not the field.** The scan below reads every `pub` field of every struct
//! in `src/config/config.rs` and asks whether the name appears anywhere outside `src/config/`.
//! On this tree that is 78 fields and exactly one answer, so the instrument is not
//! over-reporting — it is naming the single case. Any future setting that is offered and not
//! wired fails here on the day it is added.
//!
//! This repository already gates dead `pub fn`s (`a_pub_fn_nobody_calls_is_dead_tests.rs`). It
//! does not gate dead settings, which is the same question asked of the surface a *user* touches
//! rather than the one a caller touches.
//!
//! **What the scan cannot say.** A name that appears outside `src/config/` is read *somewhere*;
//! it is not proof the reading is correct. This is the cheap half, and the cheap half already
//! found the one that matters.
