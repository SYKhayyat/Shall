//! BUILDER round 6, W35's second half — the classification Shall computes has to reach the
//! caller that needs it.
//!
//! `Error::retryability()` answers "could a second attempt differ" from the backend's own exit
//! policy, and until this line existed **only two places in the program could see the answer**.
//! Everyone downstream re-derived it. The sweep harness re-derived it by RETRYING THE INSTALL
//! IMMEDIATELY, which is a proxy that is wrong for exactly the failures the classification gets
//! right: a GitHub rate limit with 1236 seconds left on the window cannot succeed one second
//! later, so it scored `defect`, the macOS leg went red, and the real-lifecycle ratchet fell
//! 8 -> 7 and went red behind it (R-3).
//!
//! So a failing command prints one line, on stderr, in a shape a script reads without grepping
//! an English sentence:
//!
//! ```text
//! shall-failure-class: permanent
//! ```
//!
//! **This file exists so the token is the stable part.** `scripts/integration-windows.sh` and
//! `docker/integration/run-in-container.sh` both read it; every other sentence Shall prints
//! about a failure is free to be reworded, and this one is not.
