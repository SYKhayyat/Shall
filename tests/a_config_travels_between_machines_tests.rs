//! One config, three machines. A line pinned to a manager this host does not have is not a
//! broken config — it is the half of the config that belongs to a different machine.
//!
//! The grammar learned this already: `app/vocab.rs` folds `priority` into the backend
//! vocabulary *specifically* so `apt:curl` parses on Windows, and says so in its own header.
//! Nothing downstream was told. `spec_is_missing` turned an unregistered backend into
//! `BackendNotFound` and failed the whole plan, so a shared `modules/` file with an `apt:` line
//! and a `winget:` line could not sync on either machine.
//!
//! The other half of the rule is here too, because a rule with only its permissive half is how
//! `AU1` starts: a package that *fails* still fails the command. Absence is a property of the
//! machine; a failed install is a property of the run.
