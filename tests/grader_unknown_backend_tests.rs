//! GRADER, 2026-07-28 — RED. `list --backend <typo>` succeeds silently.
//!
//! Principle I is "fail loud, never silent", and `install` obeys it perfectly:
//!
//!     $ shall install nosuchbackend:foo -y
//!     Error: Configuration error: <argument>: `nosuchbackend` is not a backend Shall uses
//!       add `nosuchbackend` to your `priority` file, or check the spelling.
//!     rc=1
//!
//! `list` is asked the same question and answers nothing at all:
//!
//!     $ shall list -b nosuchbackend ; echo $?
//!     0
//!     $ shall list -b aptt ; echo $?          # a typo
//!     0
//!     $ shall list -b APT  ; echo $?          # wrong case
//!     0
//!     $ shall list -b ''   ; echo $?          # empty
//!     0
//!
//! Zero rows, exit 0, no message. Which is byte-identical to what a real backend with nothing
//! installed prints — so a user who mistypes `--backend` is told, in the program's own voice,
//! that the manager is empty.
//!
//! It also quietly disarms a check the readiness rubric asks for. "Every `[READY]` backend can
//! answer `list`" is §8.1's A bar, and running `shall list -b <b>` over all 24 READY backends on
//! this host returns rc=0 for every one — but 13 of them return zero rows, which this test shows
//! is exactly what a name that does not exist returns. The assertion cannot distinguish a
//! backend that answered from one that was never consulted. That is the same shape as the
//! harness assertion that deleted its own evidence, in the check written to replace it.
//!
//! `install`'s message is the model to copy; it names the file and the fix.
