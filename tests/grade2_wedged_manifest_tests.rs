//! GRADER round 3, 2026-07-29 — RED. E1's family. A name a backend can never install is taken
//! back out of the manifest for two backends and left in for three, and the three wedge `sync`.
//!
//! E1 was the headline blocker of `READINESS-2026-07-27.md`: `shall install <typo>` left a line
//! nothing could satisfy in `modules/imperative.txt`, and every later command failed on it.
//! Round 1 closed it and I confirmed the closure on scoop. It was fixed at the instance.
//!
//! Measured today, one machine, one binary, four backends, each a name that cannot exist:
//!
//! | declaration                        | exit | line taken back out? |
//! |------------------------------------|------|----------------------|
//! | `scoop:shall-no-such-pkg-zzz`      |  1   | **yes**              |
//! | `cargo:shall-no-such-crate-zzz`    |  1   | **yes**              |
//! | `npm:shall-no-such-pkg-zzz-9`      |  1   | no                   |
//! | `github:shall-zzz-nope/nope`       |  1   | no                   |
//! | `luarocks:luafilesystem` (no Lua 5.5 rock here) | 1 | no        |
//!
//! `withdraw_what_can_never_succeed` (`src/verbs/packages.rs`) recognises exactly two
//! shapes: `Error::Unresolvable`, and `Error::CommandFailed { retry: Permanent }` **whose
//! message quotes the package name**. github raises neither — its own words are `Package
//! 'shall-zzz-nope/nope: the repo has no published release' was not found in the target
//! repository` — so the line stays. luarocks is the sharper case: Shall retried four times,
//! compared the output, and printed *"a further retry will not help — this is not the transient
//! failure its output looks like"*, and still kept the line.
//!
//! The consequence is E1 verbatim. After the github line:
//!
//!     $ shall sync -y
//!     Error: Package 'shall-zzz-nope/nope: the repo has no published release' was not found …
//!     rc=1                                    … and identically, forever
//!
//! And the sentence the user is given is the one the code's own comment forbids:
//!
//!     WARN `github:shall-zzz-nope/nope` is still declared in …/imperative.txt, so `sync` will
//!          try it again.
//!
//! `packages.rs` says, of a kept line: *"it must not be described as a transient failure.
//! '`sync` will try it again' over a … refusal promises a retry that fails identically forever,
//! which is the sentence…"*. The rule is written down, and three of the five backends sampled
//! break it.
//!
//! **The fix is not a third pattern in the match.** Two shapes were enumerated and a third was
//! found the first time anyone asked a different backend; the shape of the answer is a backend
//! saying *"this name does not exist here"* in a way the caller can read without parsing prose.
