//! The resource half of the model, for every kind — not just the one that had a reproduction.
//!
//! N-2 was found with `link:` lines: `check` reported that the machine matched while a declared
//! link was missing from disk, `sync` placed three files under `already up to date`, and `plan`
//! froze an empty plan in both directions. The cause was never about links. `check`, `plan`,
//! `apply` and `sync`'s summary each asked the *package* planner and nothing else, so every
//! kind of resource was invisible to all four: `link:`, `service:`, `setting:`, `shim:`,
//! `schedule:` and `repo:`.
//!
//! `tests/grade2_check_extras_tests.rs` and `tests/grade2_plan_extras_tests.rs` pin the
//! behaviour for `link:`. This file pins the family, and the two questions the family answers
//! differently:
//!
//! - *Has this ever been applied?* — the extras ledger's to answer, identically for all six
//!   kinds. Tested here for all five that live in a module file.
//! - *Is it still in effect?* — the machine's, and only some kinds can be asked. A `link:` is a
//!   file test and a `shim:` is a file test; a `setting:` reads back through an adapter that
//!   does not report a current value. The ones that cannot be asked are **named**, not assumed
//!   converged, because "the machine matches your files" over something nobody looked at is
//!   precisely the sentence this finding is about.
