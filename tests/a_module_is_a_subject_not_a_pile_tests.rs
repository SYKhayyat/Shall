//! **Two gates on the shape of the tree, because neither is visible to any tool this repo runs.**
//!
//! `cargo` has no opinion about a 4,000-line file or a struct with twelve public fields, and
//! clippy has none either — so both grew until a review counted them. What the count found:
//! four files over 3,000 lines, `verbs/history.rs` holding seven verbs of which none was
//! history, and `App` with 12 public fields, 49 methods and 137 call sites taking `&App`, so
//! that no handler declared what it needed and none could be tested against a narrow fake.
//!
//! Neither number is interesting on its own. What makes them worth a gate is what they cost:
//!
//! - **A file organised by size has no answer to "what else is like this?"** `registry.rs` held
//!   apt beside winget beside pip, in the order somebody wrote them, so the question *which
//!   managers need root and can take the OS with them* had no location — you scrolled.
//! - **A god object hides its dependencies, and a hidden dependency cannot be gated.** While
//!   `registry` was reachable from anywhere holding an `&App`, any code could fan out to every
//!   backend on the machine and walk past the file that says which ones Shall may use. That is
//!   not an aesthetic complaint: it is why `priority` was decorative outside resolution.
//!
//! Both lists below are exemption tables, and they are audited the way this repo audits every
//! other one — a row carries the reason it is a row, and the gate fails when the world and the
//! table disagree in *either* direction, so a row that has been earned back gets deleted.
