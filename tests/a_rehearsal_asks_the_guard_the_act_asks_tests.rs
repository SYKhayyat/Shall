//! `sync --dry-run` must consult the same guard `sync` consults.
//!
//! A rehearsal that answers a different question from the act is not a rehearsal. Measured on the
//! `tools` container image — adopt the machine, un-declare packages the guard protects, then ask
//! each surface. The only variable between the rows is the `--dry-run` flag:
//!
//! ```text
//! sync --dry-run --yes, 1 package    rc=0   protected named: 0    no refusal
//! sync --yes,           1 package    rc=3   protected named: 1    refused
//! sync --dry-run --yes, 13 packages  rc=0   protected named: 0    no refusal
//! sync --yes,          13 packages   rc=3   protected named: 10   refused
//! ```
//!
//! **`plan` gets it right, which is what makes this a defect and not a missing feature.** Same
//! tree, same state, same second:
//!
//! ```text
//! sync --dry-run   rc=0   protected named: 0    no refusal
//! plan             rc=0   protected named: 10   refusal text present
//! sync (real)      rc=3   protected named: 10   refused
//! ```
//!
//! The information is computed and available; one of the two previews of the same operation does
//! not ask for it.
//!
//! **It contradicts a rule this repository already wrote down.** `cli/args.rs` states `S25`:
//! *"**`--dry-run` never exempts anything**: a preview of a writer reads the same state a
//! concurrent writer is rewriting."* The lock is one thing a dry-run must not exempt. The guard
//! is the other, and it does.
//!
//! Longstanding rather than new: `3affcc5`, CI's last green main, behaves identically on all four
//! rows, so this predates the window in which nothing on Unix compiled.
//!
//! **What this test asserts, and what it does not.** Only that the two agree: if `plan` says a
//! removal is refused, `sync --dry-run` over the identical repository says so too. Teaching the
//! dry-run to ask, or routing both through one function, each satisfy it. It does not say which
//! exit code a dry-run should carry — that is `U21`'s and the owner's.
//!
//! **Nothing here mutates the machine.** `adopt` writes declarations into a scratch config
//! directory and installs nothing; `plan` and `sync --dry-run` are read-only. The test asserts
//! `--dry-run` is present on every `sync` it runs.
