//! GRADER round 3, 2026-07-29 — RED. `info` answers about the resolver, not about the machine.
//!
//! Two findings, one root. `Inventory::get_info` (`src/app/inventory.rs`) hands `backend:name` to
//! `resolve_spec` and then either asks exactly the backends that came back, or — when the string
//! does not resolve at all — falls through to asking **every** available backend for a package
//! literally named `nosuchbackend:foo`. Neither branch ever asks the question `install` and
//! `list` both ask: *is that prefix a backend at all?*
//!
//! **H-2 — an unknown backend prefix costs 83 seconds and gets the wrong answer.** Measured on
//! Windows, back to back, same config:
//!
//!     $ shall install nosuchbackend:foo -y
//!     Error: Configuration error: `nosuchbackend` is not a backend Shall uses
//!       add `nosuchbackend` to your `priority` file, or check the spelling.
//!     rc=1                                                             215 ms
//!
//!     $ shall list -b nosuchbackend
//!     Error: Configuration error: `nosuchbackend` is not a backend Shall uses …
//!     rc=1                                                             fast
//!
//!     $ shall info nosuchbackend:foo
//!     'nosuchbackend:foo' is not installed on this machine, so there is nothing to describe.
//!       `shall search foo` looks for it in the managers you use.
//!     rc=0                              5 523 – 83 522 ms, measured repeatedly across a day
//!
//! The spread is the network, not the build: two consecutive debug runs agreed at 82.5 s and
//! 83.5 s, and later runs of the same command on the same host ranged down to 5.5 s. The stable
//! fact is the shape — `install` refuses without asking anything, and `info` asks every manager
//! on the machine for a package none of them can have. Only the shape is asserted below.
//!
//! `list -b <typo>` was G-7 and it was fixed — `require_known_backend` is called there and the
//! `--backend` flag family (`rebuild`, `upgrade`, `repo list`) was swept with it. The
//! `backend:name` *spec* form was not, and it is the form the same user types next.
//!
//! **H-3 — `info <bare name>` denies what `list` reports.** A bare name is resolved by
//! `priority` order, not by where the package actually is, and `get_info` then asks only the
//! backend the resolver picked and returns `Ok(None)`. Measured, same machine, same binary,
//! with a control between the two:
//!
//!     $ shall list -b cargo    →  cargo  ripgrep  15.2.0
//!     $ shall info cargo:ripgrep →  Package: ripgrep  Backend: cargo  Version: 15.2.0
//!     $ shall info ripgrep     →  'ripgrep' is not installed on this machine …
//!     $ shall list -b cargo    →  cargo  ripgrep  15.2.0        (unchanged)
//!
//! `shall eval` shows the mechanism: bare `hexyl` resolves to `choco:hexyl` because `choco` is
//! first in `priority` and choco's index carries the name — so `info hexyl` asks choco, choco
//! does not have it installed, and Shall reports the package absent while `list` reports it
//! present at 0.17.0 under cargo.
//!
//! This is E6's class ("a `list` that disagrees with the machine breaks the one thing it
//! promises") on the `info` verb, and READINESS graded that one as the reason the backend layer
//! was a D. The rule the fix has to satisfy: **a read command answers about the machine, and two
//! read commands never contradict each other about it.**
