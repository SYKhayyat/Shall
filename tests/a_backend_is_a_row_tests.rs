//! **A built-in backend is a row in `builtin_backends.toml`, and the row is checked.**
//!
//! Twenty-three backends stopped being `fn register_npm(…)` in `registry.rs` and became rows in
//! a table. That trade is only worth taking if the table is checked as hard as the compiler
//! checked the functions, because a row can be wrong in ways a function cannot:
//!
//! - **A reader name that resolves to nothing.** Every named-reader field is read with
//!   `.as_deref().and_then(named::installed)` — a typo yields `None`, and `None` is a legal
//!   value meaning *fall back to the described parser*. `reads = "ws_name_versoin"` therefore
//!   compiles, loads, registers, and reports an empty machine. That is Q40's class arriving
//!   through a new door.
//! - **A `search_args` with no `searches`.** `NamedParser::new` takes `searches: Option<Search>`
//!   and substitutes a closure returning the empty vector. A row that can search and named no
//!   search reader has a live `Searchable` capability answering "no such package" to everything.
//! - **A name that is also a registrar.** `register_builtin_backends` runs first in
//!   `create_default_registry` so a hand-written registration wins a collision — deliberate, but
//!   only safe while somebody notices the collision exists.
//! - **An `install_source_option` the grammar does not know about.** The option is written in
//!   the row; the grammar decides whether `@url` is legal on this backend from
//!   `capability::install_source_key`. Two spellings of one fact, in two files.
//!
//! The argv assertions the twenty-three already had did not move: `registry.rs`'s test module
//! keeps them, with `rows_as_registrars!` standing in for the deleted functions. What did move
//! is coverage — `every_registrar_has_an_argv_row_or_a_written_reason` scans for registrars, and
//! a row is not one. `every_row_has_an_argv_row` below is that gate's other half.
