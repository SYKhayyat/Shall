//! **One `Fixture`.**
//!
//! The same twenty-five lines — a temp root, `shall init`, `run(&["…"])`, collect stdout and
//! stderr — were written **sixteen times**, and they had already drifted three ways:
//!
//! - **`current_dir`** was set by 3 of 16. The other thirteen ran the binary in the *repository
//!   root*, where a stray `shall.txt` is a project-local shell manifest the product reads.
//! - **`HOME`/`USERPROFILE`** was set by 3 of 16. The other thirteen resolved `~` to the machine's
//!   real home directory — so a test that placed a `link:` at `~/.vimrc` was writing to the
//!   developer's actual dotfiles, and passed or failed depending on where the checkout happened
//!   to sit relative to `$HOME`.
//! - **`cfg()`** existed in 11 of 16, and the five without it spelled `root.join("config")` inline.
//!
//! This is the union, and the union is the correct one in every case: a test process that cannot
//! see the developer's home directory or the repository's own working directory is the only kind
//! whose result means anything.
//!
//! **Bespoke helpers stay in their own files.** An inherent `impl` may live in any module of the
//! crate, so a test that needs `dest_mtimes()` or `seed_ledger()` keeps writing
//! `impl Fixture { … }` beside the tests that use it. What moved here is only what was identical.
