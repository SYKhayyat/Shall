//! `sbom` and `export` ask every manager one at a time.
//!
//! `latency.rs`'s `Shape` is a collapse detector for exactly this: overlap ≈ 1.0 with one wave
//! per child is the signature of a serial fan-out, and the floors were calibrated across three
//! platforms so they hold on a host nobody has measured. `the_fan_out_commands_still_fan_out`
//! drives it — and drives `list`, alone, under a name in the plural.
//!
//! Measured on Windows, 133 declarations, 17 live managers, debug build, quiet box, over the
//! same set of 21 child commands:
//!
//! ```text
//! shall list           3.59s wall   21 children summing to 20.99s   5.9x   1 wave
//! shall check health   3.47s wall   23 children summing to 22.03s   6.3x   2 waves
//! shall plan           3.68s wall   24 children summing to 14.03s   3.8x   3 waves
//! shall sbom          11.12s wall   21 children summing to 11.04s   1.0x  21 waves
//! shall export         9.42s wall   21 children summing to  9.36s   1.0x  21 waves
//! ```
//!
//! `list` overlaps the same twenty-one commands 5.9×. `sbom` and `export` overlap them not at
//! all — 1.0×, one wave each, the exact signature `Shape` names. Both fail *both* of its
//! bounds: 1.0 is under the 1.5 floor, and 21 waves is over a ceiling of 10.
//!
//! **The machinery is not missing, it is unused.** Nothing here asks for a new mechanism; the
//! concurrency that gives `list` its 5.9× is in the tree and these two commands do not reach
//! for it. On this host that is nine seconds a user waits for a report that a manager could
//! have answered in under two.
//!
//! **Why nothing caught it.** `Class::of` files both under `ConfigOnly` — *"Reads files,
//! answers, stops"* — and `Class::shape()` returns `None` for that class, so the detector never
//! looks at the two commands that trip it. The wall-clock budget the misfiling *does* give them
//! is 5s, which neither can meet: `shall sbom` prints its own `WARN … budgeted 5s` on an
//! ordinary run. A warning that fires every time is one users learn to scroll past, and it is
//! the same warning that exists to catch the next 98-second `info`.
//!
//! So this is one defect with two faces, and the second is the more expensive: the class table
//! is wrong, which simultaneously suppresses the check that would fail and enables one that
//! cries wolf.
//!
//! **The bounds are `Shape`'s, asked of the type.** Borrowed from `list` deliberately: these
//! commands carry no shape of their own, and that is the thing under test.
