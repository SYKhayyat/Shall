//! **Five independent installs are one command, and a bundle restores to the set it bundled.**
//!
//! What was here before was `test_e2e_sync_flow_hermetic` — one `brew:neovim` through resolver,
//! planner and engine, asserting `is_managed`. **It is deleted, not moved**:
//! `a_machine_converges_tests.rs` opens by naming it as the gap it exists to close, and runs the
//! same path forward, backward and forward again over a machine the mock actually updates. One
//! package, install-only, no second run is not a weaker version of that test; it is the part of
//! it that proves nothing.
//!
//! The two that remain are about things nothing else asks.
//!
//! **The batch.** A five-node graph of independent installs becomes a *single* `brew install --`
//! with five operands (`Y1`), and the terminator goes in front of the whole operand list. The
//! test that used to live here registered five separate commands and matched none of them, so
//! every assertion below ran against the mock's empty-success default — for as long as batching
//! has existed. That the planner collapses the graph is the behaviour worth pinning, not a
//! detail of how the mock is primed.
//!
//! **The bundle.** `bundle` and `restore` are one feature and the proof runs without git
//! (V.59): bundle a config, restore it into a clean directory, and assert the model resolves to
//! the same package set. A backup nothing has ever restored is a guess.
