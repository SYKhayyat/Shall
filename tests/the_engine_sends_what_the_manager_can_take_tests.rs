//! **What the executor decides before a manager is invoked** — the version it strips, the verb
//! it picks, and what a rollback puts back.
//!
//! Four branches in `execute_batch_with_retry` and two in `rollback` read a *capability* and
//! change the command line accordingly. Every one of them survived the mutation sweep, and the
//! reason is one fact about the suite rather than six oversights: the batching tests drive the
//! kernel's registry, where `pins_version()` and `supports_purge()` each have exactly one answer
//! available, so no test could put the branch under load in both directions.
//!
//! The one that matters most is the version strip. It shipped a real defect — `brew.rs` built
//! `pkg-a@1.0`, a formula name that does not exist, so a rollback failed on a Mac and passed in
//! every test, because a mock matches any string. Its guard is asserted here in all three of the
//! states it distinguishes: a manager that pins, a manager that does not, and a "version" that
//! is not a version.
