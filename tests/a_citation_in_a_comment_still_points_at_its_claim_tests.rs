//! A comment does not cite a source line by number, and every file it names exists.
//!
//! **What was found.** Comments in this tree cited each other by line number, and on 2026-08-13
//! **29 of 37 such citations no longer landed within four lines of the symbol they named**; one
//! named `e2e_tests.rs`, a file the repository had deleted. Two were load-bearing, and both were
//! in the removal guard: its escape-hatch doc claimed a grep was "the list of places that do not
//! ask", and each of the two production entries on that list justified itself by naming the line
//! where the guard is enforced instead. Both numbers were wrong — by 214 and 269 lines — and both
//! landed in unrelated code that read plausibly enough to be mistaken for the thing cited. A
//! reviewer auditing the removal guard was sent to the wrong place, twice. (That escape hatch is
//! gone as of 2026-09-28; `a_removal_token_cannot_be_minted_tests` is the gate that replaced it.)
//!
//! **Why a number and not a name.** A line number is the one citation that goes stale with
//! nobody touching it: the refactor of 2026-08-12 moved 1,800 lines and everything below it
//! shifted. Nothing noticed, which is `GRADER.md` §2.2b's class exactly — a claim with an expiry
//! and no alarm.
//!
//! **So the numbers were not corrected, they were removed** — 73 of them across 25 files.
//! Renumbering buys one green run; the next refactor takes it back. What survives is the symbol,
//! because a refactor carries a symbol with the code it names: `plan.rs`'s `apply` still points
//! at `apply` wherever it moved to, and `plan.rs:483` points at whatever is at line 483 today.
//!
//! **This gate is therefore a prohibition, and that is deliberate.** The first version asked the
//! weaker question — *do the surviving citations still land?* — and a tree with no line citations
//! left answers "yes, all zero of them". A gate phrased that way stops measuring at the exact
//! moment it starts passing, and nothing says so; the review that produced this file spends four
//! pages on instruments that read a transcription of their subject, and a vacuous gate is the
//! same failure with the subject removed entirely. A prohibition cannot go vacuous, because its
//! subject is what somebody writes tomorrow.
//!
//! *An earlier draft of the weak form is worth recording, since it is the reason the weak form
//! was weak: requiring* every *named symbol to sit near the cited line produced 53 failures where
//! hand-checking found 15, and a screening instrument that cries wolf gets deleted — after which
//! the fifteen come back.*
