//! Does `--` still mean "options end here" to the tool Shall says it means it to?
//!
//! `src/core/argv.rs` holds one boolean per binary, and four of those booleans have been wrong:
//! `asdf` read the terminator as a plugin name, `spack` read it into the spec, `gem` read it as
//! the start of C-extension build arguments and installed nothing, `nimble` handed it to the Nim
//! compiler and broke every build that produced a binary. Each was added because someone
//! recognised the family. **A family resemblance is not a measurement**, and until this file
//! there was nothing that could tell the difference.
//!
//! **The probe is differential, so it does not have to understand any tool's error prose.** The
//! same argv is run twice — once without the terminator, then once with it in front of the
//! operand — and the tool is believed to honour `--` when the two runs agree. Agreement is: the
//! same exit code, the same answer to "did it echo the operand back **as a word of its own**",
//! and no bare `--` anywhere in the output.
//!
//! **Agreement only counts once the tool has reached the operand**, and for two versions of this
//! file it did not have to. A manager that fails before resolution — no writable `COMPOSER_HOME`,
//! no network, a search that answers `[]` — agrees with itself perfectly and says nothing at all
//! about its parser, and every such pair was read as a clean pass. So there are three verdicts
//! now ([`Verdict`]) and the vacuous ones are inconclusive rather than confirming. It is not a
//! hypothetical: composer's row was flipped to non-terminating on nightlies of exactly this
//! shape, and a container run with a flag-shaped operand then showed it honouring `--` on every
//! verb. Note which way the old bug could err — a vacuous pass can only move a row *into* the
//! terminating set, which is the unsafe half of `src/core/argv.rs`'s default.
//!
//! Each of those three signals was earned. The operand check counts whole tokens because
//! `spack install -- <name>` answers `Spec ~~<name> has no name`: the terminator was absorbed
//! into the operand rather than dropped, so a substring test finds the name and calls it a pass.
//! **Every argv a binary produces is checked, not the first**, because `nimble install -- <x>`
//! looks clean while `nimble uninstall -- <x>` answers `Unknown option: --` — one binary whose
//! verbs disagree, and the conservative merge is the only safe one: a binary terminates when
//! every one of its verbs does. The without-run goes first so a tool's one-time first-run banner
//! (`Welcome to .NET 8.0!`) lands there and not in the output being read for a stray `--`.
//!
//! **A pair that disagrees is measured again before it is believed** ([`ATTEMPTS`]), and when it
//! still disagrees the report names the signal that moved and quotes both runs whole. Every
//! signal here is read off prose a manager prints only once it has resolved the operand, so a
//! network that dropped one of the two consecutive runs looks exactly like a parser that ate the
//! terminator — and a first-line-only report cannot tell the two apart afterwards.
//!
//! **What it cannot see**: a tool that parses `--` happily and mishandles it later. `nimble`
//! passes everything after `--` to the Nim compiler, which only breaks when a package actually
//! builds a binary — and a probe that never resolves a real package never reaches that. This is
//! why the table's rows carry the tool's own sentence rather than this probe's verdict: the
//! probe is a ratchet against rows nobody asked, not a replacement for having asked.
//!
//! **The argvs come from the registry, not from a list here.** A hand-written table of "the verb
//! to probe each manager with" is a second copy of the truth, and the second copy is what goes
//! stale — which is this whole file's own subject, one level up. Every backend is driven through
//! a mock, the argv it would really have run is read back, and the operand is a sentinel so its
//! position is never in doubt.
//!
//! Opt-in, because it runs the managers for real: `TERMINATOR_PROBE=1`. The names are bogus, so
//! every run fails at resolution and nothing is installed — but it is still a machine being
//! spoken to, and a test that mutates a machine should be asked for. CI runs it inside the
//! `tools` and distro images, which is where the managers are.
