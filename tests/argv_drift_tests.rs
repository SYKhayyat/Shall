//! Does every subcommand Shall invokes still exist in the tool it invokes it on?
//!
//! `pixi global upgrade-all` was removed upstream and stayed in this tree, invisible, because
//! the only thing testing it was a plan-smoke — and **a plan-smoke proves an argv was
//! *constructed*, never that it is *correct***. The argv was built perfectly every time. Nobody
//! ever asked pixi.
//!
//! So this asks. It drives every registered backend through a mock executor, reads the argv
//! Shall would really have run, and walks each subcommand chain against that manager's own
//! `--help` on this machine. It converts silent upstream drift into a named failure, which is
//! the difference between fixing `pixi` today and fixing its successor automatically.
//!
//! **It reads the argv from the code, not from a list.** A written-down table of "what Shall
//! invokes" is a second copy of the truth, and the second copy is what goes stale — which is
//! this defect's own shape, one level up.
//!
//! Only managers actually installed here can be checked. The rest are reported as skipped, by
//! name, because a gate that silently covers eight of fifty and prints a pass is the thing
//! `READINESS` is about.
//!
//! A manager that IS installed and cannot be asked is a **failure**, not a skip. That
//! distinction is the whole difference between a gate and a report: `scoop`, `npm`, `gem`,
//! `pipx` and `yarn` are all on this machine and were all skipped as "its help could not be
//! read", because this file launched them with a raw `Command` while Shall launches them
//! through an interpreter — they are `.cmd`/`.ps1` shims and `Command::new` cannot execute one.
//! Five installed managers, silently uncovered, in the gate written to stop exactly that.
//! Everything here now goes through [`shall::core::launch::effective_command`], the same
//! function the product uses.
