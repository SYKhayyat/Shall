//! Shall with a real terminal on its handles.
//!
//! Nothing else in this suite, in the container harnesses, or in CI ever ran the binary
//! attached to a pty — and a defect that lived in exactly that gap made every read come back
//! empty while the package manager's own output bled to the screen and looked like an answer.
//! `script -qec` is the cheapest pty there is; the check is that what Shall *parsed* is what
//! it *printed*, which is only true if the child's output was captured.
//!
//! The manager is a stub on `PATH`, so this proves the plumbing without needing a real apt.
