//! GRADER round 6, 2026-07-31 — RED. The gate-parity check sees **shell scripts**, and the claim
//! it guards is about **gates**. A CI job that runs no `scripts/*.sh` is invisible to it.
//!
//! Round 2 found that the parity predicate compared *basenames*, and it was fixed to compare the
//! script plus its target (`grader_gate_parity_tests.rs`). That fix inherited the original scope:
//! both `scripts/harness-logic-test.sh`'s predicate and its Rust successor scan `ci.yml` for
//! lines containing `scripts/…​.sh` and ignore every line that does not.
//!
//! **Proven by making it happen** (GRADER §0.1). Two brand-new hard gates appended to `ci.yml`,
//! neither of them a shell script, neither run by any local gate:
//!
//! ```yaml
//!   deny-unsafe:
//!     steps:
//!     - run: cargo build --release --config 'build.rustflags=["-Funsafe_code"]'
//!     - run: cargo install cargo-audit && cargo audit --deny warnings
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! $ bash scripts/harness-logic-test.sh
//! == every gate CI runs is also run by the local release scripts
//!   ok    both release scripts run all 3 gate script(s) CI runs, against the same harnesses
//! ```
//!
//! Three asymmetries are live behind that `ok` **right now**, with nothing appended:
//!
//! | CI does | the local gate does | why parity cannot see it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `cargo test --release --no-fail-fast` | `cargo test --release` | not a `scripts/*.sh` line |
//! | job `storage` — btrfs/lvm/zfs on loopback devices, **every push** | nothing | runs `docker run` directly |
//! | `containers` matrix includes `opensuse` + `void` | `DISTROS="ubuntu fedora arch alpine tools gentoo"` | matrix membership, not a script name |
//!
//! `--no-fail-fast` is not cosmetic: `ci.yml` carries a comment explaining that without it cargo
//! stops at the first failing test *target* and the rest of the suite goes unmeasured. The local
//! gate — the one a developer runs before pushing — has exactly the defect CI documented and
//! fixed.
//!
//! The B bar in `READINESS` §8.1 is "Local gates match CI exactly." This is the check that is
//! supposed to establish it.
