//! `S87` — a cleanup uninstall reported success over a package it did not remove.
//!
//! Ownership is held in memory through a sync and serialised to `registry.json` once, at the
//! end, and only when the whole transaction succeeded. The write-ahead log is written per
//! operation. The two therefore fall out of step in one direction: a run killed after an
//! install has completed leaves the package installed, `Completed` in the log, and in no
//! registry. Nothing put it right — the entry is terminal so recovery had nothing to replay,
//! the package is present so no later sync reinstalled it, and drift removal only removes what
//! Shall manages, so the one command for removing it planned no change and answered `already
//! up to date` while the binary stayed on PATH.
//!
//! Reproduced on the `void` leg on 2026-08-11 by killing a sync the moment the log recorded
//! its first `Completed`: 3 of 3 canaries on disk, an empty registry, `heal` recovering only
//! the one operation still open, then
//!
//!     why xbps:pv          -> 'xbps:pv' is not under Shall management.
//!     uninstall xbps:pv    -> already up to date        rc=0, pv STILL ON PATH
//!
//! Killing the same sync a tenth of a second later — after the final write — left all three
//! removable, which is the whole of the intermittency that made this look like a race.
