//! Is a backend data, or is it another 300 lines of Rust?
//!
//! There are two ways a backend gets written here. The good way is a `ManagerConfig` — a record
//! saying "install with these words, remove with those, list with these" — about 23 lines, no
//! logic, parsed by machinery every other data backend shares. The other way is a module with
//! its own `impl BackendCore`, its own install loop, its own remove loop, its own argv builder:
//! 200 to 400 lines, of which most is the same shape as its neighbour's.
//!
//! **The formulaic list is empty as of 2026-08-04.** It began at 29 modules; eight came out the
//! same day — `krew`, `pubdart`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `cargo`, `pipx`, `uv` — about 1,900
//! lines of Rust replaced by eight data rows. Three more came out on 2026-08-06: `pacman`,
//! `dnf` and `xbps`, whose reasons were refuted by the code beside them and whose hand-built
//! argv had lost the `--` terminator every backend on the data path gets for free. What remains
//! are 18 modules that are hand-written because the manager is, each named below with what the
//! generic machinery cannot express **and the line that makes that true**.
//!
//! Every one of the conversions cost the machinery a field rather than a compromise:
//! `extra_probes` (a manager reached as a plugin of another program), `upgrade_reinstall_args`
//! (no upgrade-all verb), `property_probes` (where the manager put it, asked with a second
//! command), `SearchSource` (a search that is an HTTP call), and a version pin that is a
//! trailing operand rather than a flag — which arrived as its own `VersionPin` variant and is
//! now read off the token, because three variants that built identical argv let two backends
//! disagree about the `--` terminator (Q30). The 2026-08-06 three cost four more: `CacheClean`
//! (how a manager empties its download cache — which no row could say at all, so forty
//! backends silently had none), `DependsProbe` (a dependency report whose *shape* is the
//! manager's), `OutdatedProbe::silence_is_none` (`pacman -Qu` exits 1 with nothing to mean
//! "nothing"), and `{name_component}` (a repository name that becomes a path segment, which
//! both hand-written modules validated and the shared repo path did not).
//!
//! All of them are now available to every backend, which is the difference between converting a
//! backend and deleting one.
//!
//! **This file is the ratchet, and it deliberately comes before the conversions.** The direction
//! doc's own instruction: *"Write the ratchet before converting anything — it is worth more than
//! the conversions, and it is what stops backend thirty-nine from being written by copying
//! thirty-eight."* A conversion sweep nobody finishes leaves two ways of doing things, which is
//! how this repo got two of everything. A list that can only shrink turns "convert backend #12"
//! from a refactor somebody has to justify into a chore with a visible finish line.
//!
//! So: every backend module is data-driven, or it is named below with the reason it cannot be.
//! Adding a name is allowed and requires writing the reason. Removing one is the work.

/// A backend module that is hand-written Rust rather than a `ManagerConfig`, and why.
///
/// **A reason here is a claim about the manager, not about the calendar.** "Not converted yet"
/// is not a reason; it is the absence of one, and an exemption list of those is a list of things
/// nobody looked at (E29). Each entry says what the *generic* machinery cannot express.
///
/// **And a claim is checked, which until 2026-08-06 it was not.** The only assertion on `why`
/// was that it ran past sixty characters, so three of these reasons described code that was not
/// in the module they excused. `pacman.rs` said *"the removal guard needs pacman's own
/// essential/required-by data"* and there was no `essential()` impl anywhere in it —
/// `grep -n essential src/backends/pacman.rs` returned nothing. `dnf.rs` described
/// `ManualListing::Command { format: SameAsInstalled }` in prose. The since-deleted `xbps.rs`
/// named three binaries
/// that are three existing fields. Sixty characters of fluent prose is what a check that cannot
/// fail looks like when the subject is English.
///
/// So each entry now points at the line that makes it true. [`HandWritten::proof`] must appear
/// in the module's own source; the reason and the code are checked against each other, and an
/// exemption whose evidence is not there fails the build.
///
/// **What this raises the floor to, and what it does not reach.** A grep cannot decide whether
/// a reason is *sound* — only whether it is about code that exists. The first proof written for
/// `brew.rs` was its own install argv, which is present and proves nothing, and finding that
/// out took reading the module. What the check buys is that writing the entry now requires
/// naming a line, and naming a line is where the three false claims would have come apart.
