//! The repo's rules about its own scripts, in the language the rules are checked in everywhere
//! else.
//!
//! Six of `harness-logic-test.sh`'s predicates never ran a script or entered a container: they
//! read `ci.yml`, the release scripts, the Dockerfiles and the harnesses as *text* and asserted
//! properties of them. Written in shell, each one paid for that twice — once in `grep | sed |
//! awk` pipelines whose failure modes are silent (`grep -c` printing `0` and exiting 1 is what
//! made the mutation gate report success on total collapse), and once in *when* they run: at the
//! end of a release script or in CI, rather than in `cargo test` beside the other twenty-seven
//! gates that do exactly this kind of reading.
//!
//! **Five of the six are here. The sixth already had a Rust successor** — see the note above
//! `every_script_is_run_by_something…`, which is the whole argument of this file arriving as a
//! near-miss on its own author.
//!
//! What stayed in shell is the half that lifts function bodies out of the harnesses and drives
//! them. That is not portable to Rust and should not be: it tests the actual bytes CI runs, in
//! the actual interpreter, which is the only technique that answers the question it asks.
//!
//! **Every scan here carries a floor.** The defect these replace is a check that stopped
//! matching the thing it audits and went on reporting `ok` — II.23. A scan whose input list came
//! back empty must fail, not pass.

// caught comparing basenames, and it is the stronger of the two: it keys on the whole

// version would have made three implementations of one question, which is the defect this
// whole file is a response to. `grade6_gate_parity_sees_whole_jobs_tests` covers the other
