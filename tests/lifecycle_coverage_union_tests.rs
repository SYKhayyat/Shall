//! Which registered backends have never had a real lifecycle *anywhere*.
//!
//! Each sweep audits only its own registry, and that is not a small gap — it is the gap that
//! hid the worst case. `winget`, `choco` and `psresource` exist only on Windows and were
//! excused there; they are absent from the Linux registry entirely. So the question *"is
//! `winget` lifecycled anywhere?"* was asked by nothing at all, and the answer was no. An
//! excuse on the only harness that can run a backend is indistinguishable from coverage.
//!
//! Measured on 2026-07-30 across the union of both registries — 60 distinct backends — **20 had
//! never completed a real lifecycle in any harness and 12 were in neither table of either one.**
//!
//! This test is the only place that sees both harnesses at once without running either, which
//! is why it reads their tables from source rather than from a run. It answers one question:
//! **is this backend reachable by a real install → list → remove somewhere in the matrix?**
//!
//! It deliberately does *not* answer "did a lifecycle ever pass" — that is a fact about CI
//! history, and `lifecycle-floor.txt` is the ratchet for it. A canary means the harness *could*.

/// from the image because its installer refused to run as root. Both gates said fine and nothing
/// ran for months.
///
/// The run-time half of that question now exists and lives in the sweep: each image writes what
/// it actually ships to `/etc/shall-image-managers`, and the coverage audit reports a manager
/// that failed to install as MISSING rather than impossible. This test and that check answer

/// **15 → 13 on 2026-08-14**, when `yay` and `paru` stopped being unreachable. Their exemption
/// had named its own closing move — *"closable with a non-root leg on the arch image"* — and the
/// arch image now runs the sweep as an unprivileged user, which is the only condition an AUR
/// helper ever asked for. Neither tool changed; the harness did.
///
/// **12 → 10 the same day**, when `service` and `setting` did. Each had been excused on the
/// evidence of one row out of five: `service` on systemd's, while SysVinit needs no running init
/// to enable or start anything, and `setting` on dconf's, while the Windows store is `reg` and
/// wants no bus. Neither statement changed either.
/// **9 → 8** the same day, when `guix` did. Its reason had already been rewritten twice as each
/// version of it was measured false; the third was *"the manager works, Shall has not driven
/// it"*, and now Shall drives it. What the image had to be taught was not about guix — a profile
/// that starts empty owes the harness a `git` and a protected package, and a manager that tells
/// you to put its bin on PATH yourself will not do it for you.
///
/// **10 → 9**, when `slackpkg` did. Its reason had been *"Slackware images exist but are
/// community-built and ship a Rust too old to build Shall in-image"*, and both halves were wrong:
/// `Dockerfile.slackware` bootstraps the toolchain through slackpkg itself and the Rust it
/// installs builds Shall. Like the four above it, the tool never changed — the harness did.
// Raised 8 -> 9 on 2026-08-16 for `nixos`, by the owner, and this is the only entry that has
// ever raised it. The rule above says it may only go down, and the remedy says a reason must be
// an impossibility rather than a cost; `nixos` is a cost. What was traded for it: the full
// lifecycle WAS driven, by hand, on NixOS 26.05 under WSL — install, list, binary on PATH,
// remove, machine still buildable — and that run found four defects the hermetic layers had all
// passed. So the number buys a backend that is measured but not gated, and the debt is a NixOS
// CI leg. Retire it by building one; do not retire it by deleting the row.
// Raised 9 -> 10 on 2026-09-04 for `moss`, the second entry ever to raise it. `moss` landed in
// `builtin_backends.toml` (1224fba) with no canary and no reason, which is Q4 item 4 happening —
// a new backend added while the current set still passes. It stays in the ceiling because the
// alternative is a fake canary: probed 2026-09-03 on `serpentos/base`, `moss remove` answers
// `Not yet implemented` and `moss install` 404s against the live CDN, so no real install → list
// → remove can complete even on AerynOS's own image. Retire it by fixing moss 0.1.0's remove
// verb and adding a canary row; do not retire it by deleting the row.
