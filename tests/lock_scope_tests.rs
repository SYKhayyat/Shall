//! No command whose duration is a person's or a loop's holds the exclusive data lock for its
//! whole run.
//!
//! `Commands::writes` decides who takes the 120-second exclusive `DataLock` for the length of
//! the process, and its own doc comment records this bug being found and fixed **three times**:
//! `edit` blocks on `$EDITOR` and "once stopped every other Shall on the machine for as long as
//! somebody read a manifest in vim"; `fleet` "took the 120-second exclusive lock for a purely
//! remote report"; `history` "opens a TUI a person reads for as long as they like". Three
//! siblings with the identical shape were never touched:
//!
//! | command | how long it held the lock |
//! |---|---|
//! | `watch` | **forever** — an unbounded `loop`; "Ctrl-C to stop" |
//! | `shell` | the length of an interactive `$SHELL` session |
//! | `run`   | the length of an arbitrary user command |
//!
//! `watch` is the sharp one. It is the GitOps daemon and the documented deployment is to leave
//! it running — so `shall install`, `shall sync` and the `hook-reconcile` a hand-typed `apt
//! install` fires all waited 120 seconds and then failed, for as long as the daemon was up. A
//! user who followed the documentation disabled their own CLI.
//!
//! The fix is `LockScope`: a command answers `Reader`, `Writer` or `Deferred`, exhaustively, so
//! a seventh instance does not compile. These tests are the other half — that the answer
//! `Deferred` is honoured rather than merely declared.
