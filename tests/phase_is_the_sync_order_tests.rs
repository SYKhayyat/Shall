//! The order of a sync is one list, and this is what keeps it one.
//!
//! **The bug this exists to prevent has already happened four times.** Which phase a statement
//! kind belongs to was written down in places that could not check each other — the dispatch
//! in `sync`, the dry-run branch's copy of it, `DesiredState`'s per-kind accessors, and
//! `has_non_package_work`'s chain of ors — and every kind added since was missed by one of
//! them: extras (S20), then `exec:`, then `dotfiles:`, then `firewall:`. `verbs/sync.rs`
//! records the bill in its own words.
//!
//! `Statement::phase()` is now the single answer and the compiler checks it: a new statement
//! kind cannot compile until it has been given a phase. What the compiler *cannot* check is the
//! other half — that `sync`'s dispatch has an arm for every phase — because `verbs/` is
//! declared in `main.rs` and is not reachable from any test binary. So the dispatch is gated
//! here the way the removal surface is: from the source, on every run.
//!
//! **Why a source scan.** The finding is about a phase that exists and is *not dispatched*. No
//! behavioural test can enumerate the phases nobody wired up — that is the shape of the bug.
