//! Every statement kind that carries `@options` is refused a bogus one, in its own words.
//!
//! The lookup this quantifies over used to match the kind as a *string*, ending in
//! `_ => SCHEDULE_OPTION_KEYS`. Nothing was wrong on the day it was written — every caller
//! passed a spelling that had an arm — but a kind added later would have inherited schedule's
//! options in silence: `@cron` accepted on a thing with no schedule, its own options refused,
//! and no error anywhere to say so.
//!
//! The lookup is exhaustive over an enum now, so the tenth kind cannot compile without naming
//! its table. This is the other half: that the table is *reached*, and that the refusal names
//! the kind the user actually wrote. A kind wired to the wrong table still compiles.
