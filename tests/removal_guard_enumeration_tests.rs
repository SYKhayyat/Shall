//! The check that would have caught G-1: enumerate every path that removes something from
//! the machine, from the code, and require each one to be accounted for.
//!
//! `README.md` says "**every path that removes anything** goes through one guard".
//! `src/app/sync/guard.rs`'s own module doc says "*Every* path that deletes is guarded... A
//! guard on one command is a guard on nothing." Both sentences were true when written. Neither
//! was ever re-derived, and by 2026-07-28 the count was eleven sites and nine guards — the
//! `link:`/`service:`/`setting:`/`shim:`/`schedule:`/`repo:` teardown in `app/apply/extras.rs`
//! and the `shall repo remove` verb in `verbs/declare.rs` both deleted without asking.
//!
//! A sentence that quantifies over paths is only as good as the last time someone counted the
//! paths. This test does the counting on every run.
//!
//! **Why a source scan and not a behavioural test.** The finding is about a path that *exists*
//! and is *not covered*; no behaviour can enumerate the paths nobody wrote a test for — that
//! is the shape of the bug. So this asserts a structural property, and it earns its keep the
//! only way such a check can: adding a removal call anywhere in `src/` fails it until someone
//! writes down which guard stands in front of it. It is deliberately not a grep for the word
//! `guard` — `scripts/grader-red-tests.sh` was deleted for being exactly that.
