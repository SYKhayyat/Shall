//! Which managers cannot tell Shall that a package name does not exist.
//!
//! N-1 was E1 — a name nothing can install, left in `modules/imperative.txt`, failing every
//! later command — found alive on `npm` and `github` after it had been closed on `scoop` and
//! `cargo`. The interesting part is not that two backends were missed. It is that **nothing
//! anywhere held the bound**: withdrawal read a classification only 12 of 48 backends could
//! produce, and which 12 was not written down, not counted, and not derivable from anything
//! short of reading every registration site.
//!
//! So this file derives the set from the registry and compares it against a recorded one. A
//! backend that gains an absent-name classification must leave the list; one that loses it, or
//! a new backend registered without one, must join it, and either way somebody has to look.
//! The list is a measurement with a date on it, not a target.
//!
//! An uncovered backend is not broken — an unclassified failure keeps the declaration, which
//! is the safe direction. It is *silently limited*, which is the thing this repo keeps paying
//! for: `CLAUDE.md`'s "no silent caps" and `GRADER` §2's rule that a check must be able to
//! fail both say the same thing, which is that a bounded claim has to state its bound.

/// Every installable backend that cannot yet report a missing name.
///
/// A **set**, not a count, and the reason is the finding one layer up: which backends are
/// registered depends on the platform (48 on Windows, 56 on Ubuntu), so a number would mean a
/// different thing on every runner and could pass on one while a backend regressed on another.
/// A covered backend never appears here whatever the platform, so this list shrinks as work
/// lands and goes red the moment a name joins it.
///
/// Measured 2026-07-29 on Windows for the 36 registered here, after N-1 added `npm`, `gem`,
/// `pipx`, `go` and `pixi`. The ten platform-gated entries below are the ones this host does
/// not register, read from the `cfg!(target_os)` blocks in `backends::registry`; CI on Linux
/// and macOS is what confirms them, and a name missing from this list turns those legs red
/// rather than passing quietly, which is the point.
///
/// Deleting a name is the work. Each one is a manager that can then say "no such package"
/// instead of wedging a config, and its phrasing has to come from that manager's own output —
/// see the dated captures in `src/core/exit_policy.rs`. Never a guess: a wrong marker deletes
/// a declaration whose package is real.
///
/// **Twelve to twenty-five on 2026-08-21, and the method matters more than the number. THREE
/// QUESTIONS PER MANAGER, not one.** An install resolves a name, an index and a version, and a
/// marker is safe only once all three have been asked - so each phrasing came from running that
/// manager's own install argv three ways: against a name that does not exist, against the same
/// name with `--network none`, and against a package that DOES exist at an impossible version.
/// A backend on `capability::CANNOT_PIN_VERSION` has no third axis by construction, which is
/// how `nix`, `krew` and `slackpkg` are safe without one.
///
/// **The third question found a marker that had already shipped wrong.** `pipx` carried
/// `no matching distribution found for`, and pip says that about a VERSION as readily as about
/// a name - so a bad `@version=` on a real package withdrew its declaration. The fixture below
/// used to be a one-line capture that stopped just above the line carrying the answer, which is
/// how a wrong marker passed the test written to catch it. `(from versions: none)` is the
/// discriminator, and `pip` inherits both the bug and the fix.
///
/// The other two passes earn their keep too: `mix` answers from a stale cache when Hex is
/// unreachable in the same words it uses for a name that never existed, and `dart pub` refuses
/// a hyphenated name before it asks pub.dev at all.
///
/// **The first sweep was scoped to `builtin_backends.toml` and reported as if it were the whole
/// board.** It was one table of two: every Rust-implemented backend was invisible to it, and
/// eight of those were sitting in the `tools` image already built. `bun`, `conda`, `dotnet`,
/// `mise`, `nix` and `pip` came from the second pass. Whatever asks this question next should
/// take its list from the registry, which is what the test below already does.
///
/// What is left here is what no machine to hand could ask. `guix`, `emerge` and `eopkg` have
/// nightly images and want that leg. `yarn` is a different shape of gap: it answers
/// `https://registry.yarnpkg.com/<name>: Not found`, which puts the package name BETWEEN the
/// two halves that would identify the sentence, so no contiguous marker matches it. `pnpm` and
/// `asdf` never reach a lookup on the install path Shall drives.
