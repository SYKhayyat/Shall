//! BUILDER round 6, B36 / R-5's sibling R-6 — `heal` reported an operation it could not
//! recover at rc=0, in Rust's `Debug` syntax, with advice its own classifier contradicts.
//!
//! Measured by the round-5 grader, an `InProgress` install planted for a package that does not
//! exist:
//!
//!     ERROR could not recover npm:… — Some(CommandFailed { message: "…404…",
//!     retry: Permanent, absent_name: true }). The system may be in a partial state for this
//!     package; re-run `shall sync`.
//!      WARN 1 operation(s) could NOT be recovered: npm:… . Re-run `shall sync`.
//!     heal: reconciled locks/versions.json (1 entries)
//!     heal: refreshed backend metadata
//!     heal rc=0
//!
//! Three defects, and the behaviour underneath is right and must stay right: `heal` attempts
//! the recovery, fails, and **leaves the entry `InProgress`** rather than closing it. That is
//! the answer a "mark everything done" implementation gets wrong.
//!
//!   1. rc=0 after "1 operation(s) could NOT be recovered". `shall heal && echo ok` printed ok.
//!   2. `{:?}` on an `Option<Error>` printed at the user — `retry: Permanent`,
//!      `absent_name: true`, internal field names and all.
//!   3. The advice contradicted the struct it had just printed: `absent_name: true` means the
//!      name does not exist, and it said "re-run `shall sync`".
//!
//! **The fixture is `cargo uninstall` of a crate this machine does not have.** The grader
//! recorded that it could not automate this, because a planted `Install` entry needs a network
//! round-trip and a hand-written one omitting `options` lands in the corrupt-WAL branch instead
//! of the recovery branch. A planted **Remove** parses (the dry-run gate already relies on
//! that), and `cargo` is on every runner that builds Shall, so its recovery fails locally,
//! deterministically, and with no network at all.
//!
//! `github:` was tried first and does **not** work: removing an artifact the lock has never
//! heard of succeeds, so there is nothing to fail. That is recorded because a fixture that
//! silently recovers would make every assertion below vacuous.
