//! One ecosystem going down upstream must not leave the rest of the machine unconverged.
//!
//! `Y15` settled the neighbouring case in August: a line pinned to a manager this host does not
//! have is not a broken config, it is the half of the config that belongs to a different
//! machine, so it is skipped and the run succeeds. It then drew the line at *a package that
//! fails still fails the command* - with two categories available, because in August every
//! failure of the third kind arrived as `Retryability::Unknown` and there was nothing to key on.
//!
//! There is now. On 2026-08-21 Hackage rotated its TUF root past the trust anchors compiled into
//! the cabal-install Ubuntu ships. Nothing about the user's config was wrong, nothing they could
//! type would fix it, and nothing about tomorrow's run is different - and under the old rule one
//! such line stopped every declaration the planner had not yet dispatched from being attempted
//! at all.
//!
//! **The mode is not `--keep-going` under another name**, and the last two tests are what say so:
//! a `Permanent` failure still ends the run, and the limit of what carrying on buys is measured
//! here rather than assumed.
