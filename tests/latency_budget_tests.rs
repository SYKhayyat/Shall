//! How long a command is allowed to take.
//!
//! Nothing measured latency, which is how a 98-second `shall info cargo:ripgrep` shipped —
//! answering "not found" the whole time, while `shall search ripgrep` in the same tree found
//! it. The cause was that the `cargo:` qualifier was ignored and every backend on the machine
//! was asked for a package literally named `cargo:ripgrep`.
//!
//! **These are ceilings, not targets.** They are set well above what the commands actually
//! take here (a qualified `info` measures ~0.2s against a 5s budget) so that a normal machine
//! under normal load never goes red, and a regression of the *shape* that produced E14 — a
//! probe fanning out across every backend when it was told which one to ask — cannot pass.
//! A budget tight enough to fail on a busy CI runner is a budget people delete.
//!
//! **And where a claim can be counted instead of timed, it is.** Every ceiling here approximates
//! a property — "asks one manager", "asks none" — that `--timings` reports directly, and the
//! count does not move when the box is loaded while the clock moves by two orders of magnitude.
//! So the counted form is the assertion and the clock is the corroboration, gated on a control
//! run proving the host is quiet. The reverse arrangement is what produced a red suite over a
//! `shall eval` that had measured 0.14s an hour earlier.

//
// R-9 says "nothing measures latency". **This file already did**, committed in `02a4ec9` with
// W14's fix: two ceilings and one call-counting property test. What did not exist is what
// §8.1's A+ line actually names — a budget PER COMMAND CLASS, covering more than `info`, and a
// number reaching the user when one is crossed. That is what is added here, in this file
// rather than in a second one.
//
// Measured for this order on Windows, 24 ready backends, debug build, 111 adopted packages:
//
//     policy / vars / eval / check config        0.13 – 0.32 s
//     list                                       3.4  – 3.9  s
//     check health                               4.3  – 5.4  s
//     check                                      8.5  – 18.3 s
//
// The split is the finding, and it decides which classes carry a budget at all: a command that
// reads only files is fast on every machine, and one that asks every manager costs whatever
// the managers cost — a fact about the host. So `EveryBackend` and `Mutating` carry none, and
// saying that out loud is better than a number nobody can defend.
