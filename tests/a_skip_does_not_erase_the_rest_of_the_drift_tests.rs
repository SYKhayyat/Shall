//! One skipped declaration must not erase every other kind of drift from `check`.
//!
//! `check.rs` matches `!c.skipped.is_empty()` **before** the arm at `check.rs` that
//! prints the counts, so the two are alternatives rather than a sum. A machine with one skipped
//! declaration and a hundred pending changes reports the skip and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! ->  drift  0 to install, 0 to remove, 1 to place, 0 to undo          (no skip)
//! ->  drift  1 package(s) installed and declared nowhere that `sync`   (one skip added;
//!            will not remove: apt:tree ...                              the resource is gone)
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing about the machine changed between those two lines except that one more declaration
//! was added, for a manager this host does not have. The declared file is still absent from
//! disk and `sync` would still place it.
//!
//! **The resource is lost from the JSON as well, and that is the half that cannot be argued.**
//! Package work survives in `counts` — `install` and `remove` are attached to both arms — but
//! resources have no key there. `r.summary()` inside the summary *string* is the only place a
//! pending `link:` is ever reported, and the skip arm writes a different string. The full drift
//! node this fixture produces is:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"counts":{"install":0,"remove":0,"skipped":1},"ok":false,"section":"drift",
//!  "summary":"1 package(s) installed and declared nowhere that `sync` will not remove: ..."}
//! ```
//!
//! There is no reading of that document under which a file is missing from disk.
//!
//! **`plan` knows.** The same fixture, same moment: *"0 install(s), 0 removal(s), 1 resource(s)
//! to place"*. The fact is computed and available; `check` discards it.
//!
//! **How a real machine gets here.** `sudo` ships `secure_path` set to the system directories
//! only, so `cargo`, `bun` and `uv` — installed under `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.bun/bin` and
//! `~/.local/bin` — are not on the PATH of anything run through it. Measured on stock Ubuntu:
//! the identical repository reports `4 to install` normally and, under `sudo`, three skips and
//! no counts at all.
//!
//! Distinct from the claim in `a_skipped_install_is_not_an_undeclared_leftover_tests.rs`: that
//! one is about the sentence being false, this one is about the true sentences it replaces. The
//! detail view `shall check drift` is not a counter-example — it lists no resources in either
//! state, which is its own smaller gap and not caused by the skip.
