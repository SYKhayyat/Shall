//! **The second half of II.52: a blocking wait does not sit on a runtime worker.**
//!
//! II.52 has two halves and only one of them had a gate.
//! `a_spawned_child_has_an_owner_tests` fails on a `Command` that reaches
//! `spawn`/`output`/`status` outside the executor — that is the *process* half, and it is
//! complete. The *blocking-wait* half had nothing at all: nothing in the tree enumerated an
//! `fsync` under a lock, a synchronous `walkdir` inside an `async fn`, or a synchronous
//! interpreter eval on a shared task, and `core::blocking::off_the_runtime` — the door II.52
//! names for "work that can move" — had exactly **one** caller in the whole codebase.
//!
//! Eight sites were found by hand on 2026-08-18, in five files:
//!
//! - eleven call sites wrote the registry while holding the global state mutex, so every one of
//!   the sixty other `state.lock()` sites waited out a physical disk flush;
//! - the WAL flushed once per package, un-batched, under the journal mutex, on the path that
//!   opens every wave — ~298 flushes before a single manager was invoked on a 298-package
//!   config;
//! - `github:` and `web:` flushed inside the install wave, under their own lock;
//! - `model::cache` ran a `walkdir` over `~/.cache` and `/var/cache` on a runtime worker, once
//!   per artifact;
//! - `#rhai` hooks evaluated synchronously from an `async fn`, with Rhai's own `http_get`
//!   blocking on a channel recv for a whole HTTP round trip.
//!
//! Every one of those is a *correct call to a correct door made in the wrong scope*, which is
//! why `a_writer_that_reaches_the_disk_goes_through_one` passes all of them: it asks whether
//! the write goes through `durable_write`, and says nothing about what the caller is holding
//! while it happens. V.182 makes the argument for closing this better than this comment can —
//! *"a list of sites fixed is a fact about one afternoon; a predicate that fails the build is a
//! fact about every afternoon after it."*
//!
//! **Why it matters more here than in most codebases.** This tree deliberately multiplexes its
//! hottest fan-outs onto a *single task* (`planner.rs`: *"the futures borrow `&self` so this
//! stays on one task (no spawn)"*). A blocking call reached from inside a wave therefore does
//! not cost one task's latency; it costs the whole wave's.
