# Shall

Declarative configuration for a machine: you write down what it should have, and `sync` makes
the machine match. The name is what a line in that file means: *this machine **shall** have
ripgrep.*

**Packages are the largest kind and not the only one.** Repositories, services, schedules,
symlinks, OS and desktop settings, scripts, generated declarations, dotfile trees and firewall
rules are all declared in the same files, by the same grammar, and converged by the same
`sync`.

Shall does not replace apt, pacman, brew, cargo or npm — nor systemd, ufw or gsettings. It
drives them. One file says what the machine should have; `shall sync` adds what is missing,
removes what is no longer listed, and leaves everything else alone.

```
$ cat ~/.config/shall/modules/tools.txt
apt:ripgrep
cargo:bat
npm:typescript@version=>=5.0.0

$ cat ~/.config/shall/profiles/Main
use tools

$ shall sync
Planned changes:
  install 3   remove 0   (total 3 change(s))
```

Delete the `cargo:bat` line and sync again, and `bat` is uninstalled. That is the whole idea:
**the file is the truth, and every command is a shortcut for editing it and syncing.**

Note the second file. A module is a *list*; it does nothing until an active profile `use`s it.
That indirection is what lets one repo describe several machines — see [Profiles](#profiles).

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SYKhayyat/Shall/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SYKhayyat/Shall/HEAD/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Either script downloads the published binary for your platform, runs `shall check`, and offers
to `adopt` the packages already on the machine. Nothing else is needed — no toolchain, no
compiler. Seven builds are published: Linux on x86_64 and arm64, against glibc and musl both;
macOS on Intel and Apple silicon; and x86_64 Windows. Anywhere else the script falls back to
building from source, which needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and takes rather longer than thirty
seconds. The scripts run `--version` on what they downloaded before trusting it, and build from
source if it will not start.

`SHALL_REF=v0.8.0` installs an exact release instead of the newest. From a checkout:

```bash
cargo build --release
cp target/release/shall ~/.local/bin/
```

## Start

```bash
shall init          # scaffold ~/.config/shall, with one profile (Main) already active
shall install jq    # writes a line you own, then syncs
shall check         # what needs you: drift, unmanaged, health — read-only
shall sync          # make the machine match the files
```

`shall install` is not a separate mechanism — it writes `jq` into a module that the active
profile already reaches, then syncs. Anything it can do, editing the file does too.

Writing a module by hand takes one extra step, because a module is inert until something uses
it:

```bash
echo 'cargo:ripgrep' > ~/.config/shall/modules/tools.txt
echo 'use tools'    >> ~/.config/shall/profiles/Main
shall check                # every question at once; `shall check drift` for one
shall --dry-run sync       # preview
shall sync
```

`shall check` is the fastest way to confirm a file is actually being read: it reports how many
lines resolved. If you edited a module and `check` still says `0 present`, no active profile
is using it.

## The files

They live under `$SHALL_CONFIG_DIR` (default `~/.config/shall`). `shall init` creates the ones
every machine needs; the rest appear when you first use the feature they belong to, and are
marked below. **This directory is meant to be a git repo** — `shall git init` turns on version
control, after which every sync commits, and `shall rollback <commit>` puts the machine back.

`shall path` prints where they are, so you never have to remember. To keep them somewhere else
— a dotfiles repo, a shared drive — `shall path --set ~/dotfiles/shall` records it once and
every later run finds it. For a single run, `--config-dir` wins over everything; the full order
is `--config-dir`, then `$SHALL_CONFIG_DIR`, then the stored path, then the default, and
`shall path --explain` tells you which one answered.

```
modules/       your lists of packages       lowercase names, *.txt
profiles/      named sets you turn on and off       Capitalized names
active         which profiles are on right now
priority       which package managers this machine uses, in order
groups         named backend chains, so `tools:rg` means `apt,cargo:rg` (optional)
vars           your own names for conditions, so `when` can ask about them
schedules      when Shall runs itself (written by `shall schedule`)
locks/         what everything resolved to, one file per backend
adapters/      what you have taught Shall — see below (optional)
preferences.toml   refusals and behaviour (written by `shall config init`)
```

Working versions of all of these are in [`examples/`](examples/) — a module of packages, a
module of the things that are not packages, a profile, and a fully commented
`preferences.toml`. They are not illustrations: the test suite parses every one of them with
the same grammar and the same `Config` type the program uses, so an example that stopped being
true would fail the build rather than mislead you.

Shall's own bookkeeping — what it currently owns, snapshot metadata — lives in
`$SHALL_DATA_DIR`, never in the config repo and never in git.

Facts about the machine are **detected, not configured**: core count, whether btrfs/ZFS/
Timeshift exists, which managers are installed. The one exception is `max_parallel`, which you
may set by hand to cap concurrency below the core count.

## The grammar

A file is lines. A line is blank, a comment, a statement, or a block. **An unrecognised line is
an error** naming the file, the line, and what was expected — never a silently ignored typo.

```
# a comment
apt:curl                  # explicit backend
ripgrep                   # bare name: resolved via `priority`, then locked
apt:re:^python3-.*        # regex against that backend's names
absent:snap:firefox       # must NOT be installed
nixos:ripgrep             # NixOS only: into the system configuration, not a profile
repo:apt:ppa:foo/bar      # a repository
shim:node                 # a PATH stand-in
service:nginx             # a service
link:./dotfiles/vimrc     # a managed file
use editors               # pull in another module
```

`use` takes **a name, never a path or a URL.**

On NixOS, `nix:` and `nixos:` are different things and both are useful. `nix:jq` is
`nix profile install` — a per-user package, and what `nix:` means on a Mac or an Ubuntu box too.
`nixos:jq` goes into the machine's system configuration, so installing it becomes a NixOS
generation that `nixos-rebuild --rollback` knows about. Shall writes a `shall-packages.nix` it
owns outright and imports it from your `configuration.nix`; see [Configuration](#configuration)
for the `[nixos]` keys.

On that machine your `service:` and `firewall:` lines go into the same file, because that is
where NixOS reads them — `services.<name>.enable`, `networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts` and
`allowedUDPPorts`, and `networking.firewall.enable` for a `firewall:default/incoming` policy.
One `nixos-rebuild` applies all of it. `@status=restarted` still goes to the init, since a
restart is a transition no attribute can declare, and a line NixOS has no attribute for — a
service declared both enabled and running-while-disabled, or a default *outgoing* policy — is
refused by name rather than half-applied.

A prefix can be a chain — `apt,cargo:ripgrep` means "apt if it has it, else cargo." If you write
the same chain often, name it once in a `groups` file and use the name:

```
# groups
tools   = apt, dnf, cargo
windows = scoop, winget
all     = tools, windows      # groups can contain groups
```

Then `tools:ripgrep` expands to `apt,dnf,cargo:ripgrep`. It is only a shortcut — it resolves
exactly as the chain would, `priority` is unchanged, and a group that reaches itself is refused.

**A name is whatever the manager calls it.** If `shall list` prints it, you can write it back:

```
npm:@angular/cli                       # a scoped package — the leading @ is part of the name
npm:@angular/cli@version=17.3.0        #   ...and a later @ still opens the options
winget:ARP\Machine\X64\{8BD2A40D-...}    # what winget calls an installed MSI
cargo:serde_json                       # underscores, dots, plus signs, slashes
```

That is a rule rather than a list of exceptions: a manager's names are facts, and where they and
the grammar disagree, the grammar gives way (V.113). The one thing a name may never contain
is `..`.

A config file may also start with a **byte-order mark** — what Notepad writes — and Shall reads
it anyway (Q22). It is an encoding artefact, not part of your first backend's name.

### Options

Short form for simple values, block form for anything with a comma:

```
apt:jq@version=1.6
npm:typescript@version=>=5.0.0

apt:nginx {
  after_install = ./setup.sh --flag=a,b
  requires      = apt:libfoo
  requires      = apt:libbar        # a key given twice makes a list
}
```

A comma inside a short-form value is an error that tells you to use the block form, rather than
a guess about where the value ended. In a block, everything after the first `=` is the value,
verbatim and trimmed — no escaping exists because none is needed.

Common keys: `version`, `hold` (never upgrade), `expires` / `until` (absolute datetimes),
`requires`, `health` (see [Safety](#safety)), `shim` (put a PATH stand-in for this tool in your
`bin_dir`; `sandbox` does that and confines `shall run` too — both declare the same thing a
`shim:` line does, so adding one to a package you already have creates the stand-in and deleting
it takes the stand-in away), the `*_install` hooks, and
per-directive keys like `cron`/`run` on `schedule:` or
`target`/`content`/`template`/`decrypt`/`identity` on `link:` — the last two are
[Secrets](#secrets).

**A `schedule:` also takes `enabled`, `persistent`, `jitter` and `elevated`** — provision it and
leave it silent, run a firing the machine was switched off for, spread a fleet out around the
scheduled moment, run at the highest privilege the account holds. No scheduler has all four
(a `--user` systemd timer cannot raise its own privilege, launchd has no randomised delay, and
`schtasks` can set neither `RandomDelay` nor `StartWhenAvailable`), so each one either expresses
the option or **refuses it by name before it writes anything** — never accepts it and drops it.
An option you do not write is never refused and never changes what the schedule does. Shall reads
schedules back out of the scheduler that holds them, so editing `cron` or `run` is reported as
work rather than passing as *nothing to do*; a trigger Shall did not write is reported as *cannot
read back* rather than as drift.

Some keys belong to one family of backends and are refused, by name, anywhere else — `@classic`
on a snap, `@system` on pip, and the storage keys below. An option no backend would read is an
error rather than a line that quietly does nothing.

**`pip:` on Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, openSUSE or Fedora.** Those distros mark their Python as
belonging to the system package manager (PEP 668), and pip refuses to install into it — rightly,
because two package managers writing one `site-packages` is how a system python stops working.
Shall refuses with them and names the two things a line can do instead:

```
pipx:black                 # its own environment — the tool built for this, and Shall drives it
pip:black@system=true      # write into the system Python anyway, on this line only
```

`@system` applies to the line that carries it and to nothing else: a wave containing both forms
becomes two commands, so one package's permission is never handed to the ones beside it.

**Adding `@classic` to a snap you already installed re-confines it** on the next sync, rather than
waiting for a reinstall. Taking it away manages nothing — Shall will not silently reconfine a
snap because a word left the file. Writing `@classic=false` on a snap that *is* classic is
refused, because snapd can relax confinement in place but cannot narrow it, and the only way back
is to remove and reinstall — which the error tells you.

**A `link:` line puts your file back when you delete it.** If the destination already held a
file, Shall keeps it as `<target>.shall-backup` before taking the path over; removing the
declaration restores that file and deletes the backup. So a `link:` line that comes and goes
leaves the machine as it found it, and backups do not pile up. If nothing was there to begin
with, removing the line removes the file. **The source in your repo is never touched** — a
declaration owns its destination, not your copy.

### Which file gets installed

`github:sharkdp/fd` names a repo, not a file. One release ships a `.deb`, a `.tar.gz`, an
`.AppImage` and a bare binary, so Shall has to choose — and a declaration that resolves to a
different file on two machines is not declarative.

`formats` is an ordered preference. First match wins; a later entry is a fallback:

```
github:BurntSushi/ripgrep {
  formats = appimage
  formats = tarball
  formats = binary
}
```

The vocabulary is closed — `deb rpm appimage tarball zip exe msi pkg dmg binary` — and an
unrecognised name is an error listing the legal set. **You do not need to write any of this**:
the default order comes from your OS and distribution, so a fresh repo installs the right thing
with no `formats` line anywhere.

Your architecture is not a preference. Assets that cannot run on this machine are filtered out
before `formats` is consulted, so there is no `@arch=` to get wrong.

When a release ships two files that both fit, Shall picks the one that names your machine
most precisely — `fd-…-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` over a bare `amd64` build — then the
shorter name, and **tells you what it chose and what it skipped**. If you write `@formats=`
yourself, that order wins instead: you asked for it. To decide yourself, `@asset=` takes a filename
or a glob that survives version bumps:

```
github:sharkdp/fd@asset=*musl*
```

For an archive, Shall extracts it, finds the executable and shims it onto your `PATH`. When the
archive holds several and the guess would be wrong, `@bin=` names it:

```
github:foo/bar@bin=build/bar
```

Finding no executable, or several, is an error listing what the archive held — never a silent
pick.

`channel` is the other half, for backends that ship one artifact in several version streams:

```
snap:code@channel=stable
```

Both keys are errors on a backend they do not apply to, rather than being quietly ignored.

### Storage you can declare

A btrfs subvolume, a ZFS dataset and an LVM logical volume are declarations like any other —
they have a size and a mountpoint rather than a version, and that is the only thing that makes
them different:

```
btrfs:/mnt/fs/srv@quota=20G,mount=/srv
zfs:tank/media@quota=500G,mount=/mnt/media
lvm:vg0/data@size=100G
```

`@size` is required on `lvm:` — `lvcreate` has no default, so a volume with no size is not a
declaration of anything. `@mount` writes the entry to `/etc/fstab`, which is what makes the
mount survive a reboot; deleting the line takes the entry out **before** the volume is
destroyed, because an fstab entry naming a volume that no longer exists stops the next boot.
`@mount_options` fills that entry's option field — btrfs only, since ZFS keeps its mount
properties on the dataset, and an error without `@mount`, because there is then no entry for it
to fill.

**Editing one of these numbers changes the volume.** Raise `@quota` and the next sync raises the
quota; raise `@size` on an `lvm:` volume and it grows, filesystem and all. Lowering `@size`
shrinks it, and that is the one change here that can lose data — so it needs saying on the line:

```
lvm:vg0/data@size=50G,allow_shrink=true
```

Without `@allow_shrink`, a smaller `@size` is refused and the error names what the volume is now
and what you asked for. With it, Shall shrinks the filesystem before the volume, so a filesystem
that cannot shrink (xfs) stops the operation rather than losing its tail. `@allow_shrink` is
`lvm:` only — lowering a quota takes nothing away — and an error without `@size`, because on its
own it permits nothing. Dropping an option stops declaring it; it does not lift what it declared,
so deleting `@quota=` leaves the quota where it is.

**Deleting one of these lines destroys a filesystem, and that goes through the ordinary removal
guard** — no special escalation, because ordinary is already the strongest gate here. A volume
is protectable like a package, counts against `max_removals`, and the destruction is previewed
before the guard clears it.

### Host conditions

`when` gates the lines inside it, and it works the same way in every file — packages in a
module, imports in a profile, backends in `priority`, profile names in `active`:

```
when os == linux {
  apt:htop
}

when host in [laptop, tablet] {
  apt:tlp
}
```

Keys: `os`, `arch`, `host`, `hostname`, `family`. Operators: `==`, `!=`, `in [a, b]`.

`os` is the kernel — `linux`, `macos`, `windows`. `family` is the distribution — `debian`,
`fedora`, `arch`, `suse`, `alpine` — so `when family == debian` also covers Ubuntu and Mint,
which is usually what you meant when you asked.

**And you do not have to write one.** A line naming a manager this machine does not have is
skipped, not an error:

```
apt:ripgrep
winget:BurntSushi.ripgrep
brew:ripgrep
```

That file works on all three machines. Each one installs its own line and reports the other two
as skipped, naming the manager it does not have — `sync` still succeeds. `when` is for when you
want a *different* package on a different host; this is for the same package under three names,
which is most of what a portable config is.

Skipped, never silent: the skips are listed at the end of a run and are in `--json`, and a run
whose every line was skipped does not claim to be up to date. A **misspelled** manager is still
an error — `brwe:ripgrep` is caught when the file is read, because a config that quietly ignored
its own typos would describe a machine nobody has.

None of this applies to a package that genuinely fails to install: that stops the command, on
every machine. Pass `--keep-going` if you would rather have the rest of the run — it installs
each package on its own command line so a bad name cannot take the good ones with it, and it
**still exits non-zero**, naming what failed. Continuing past a failure is not reporting success.

## Profiles

A profile is a named set of modules you can turn on and off live, with no reboot. Several can
be active at once — their package sets are unioned.

```bash
shall activate work           # `active` becomes exactly: work
shall activate -a gaming      # add gaming to what is already on
shall deactivate gaming       # drop it, removing only what nothing else needs
shall profile list
```

`activate` sets, `activate -a` adds, `deactivate` removes. `activate` overwrites the whole
`active` file including any `when` blocks in it, and says which ones it removed; `activate -a`
and `deactivate` never rewrite a block that does not apply to this host, because `active` is a
shared file and another host's block is another machine's business.

## The removal guard

Drift is derived from managed state, and managed state can be wrong — a mis-scoped manifest, a
state file from another machine. So **every path that removes anything** goes through one guard.
That covers packages *and* the resources a declaration puts in place — a `link:`, `service:`,
`setting:`, `shim:`, `schedule:` or `repo:` line that leaves your modules is torn down under the
same rules, against its own limit. That sentence is not a promise in prose:
`tests/removal_guard_enumeration_tests.rs` counts the removal paths in the source on every run,
so a new one that skips the guard fails the build.

The guard refuses when a removal:

- exceeds a ceiling. There is one per kind and one over all of them: `max_removals`
  (packages, default 20), `max_extra_removals` (resource teardowns, 20), `max_port_closures`
  (ports nothing declares, 20), `max_installs` (off by default) and `max_total_changes` —
  everything one command does, installs and upgrades included, off by default. A refusal names
  every ceiling it hit, because a set can be over two at once,
- is out of proportion to what Shall manages. `purge_ratio` (default `0.1`) refuses a sweep that
  would remove more than ten times what Shall is managing — the case a count cannot catch, because
  on a small machine "delete all fourteen" is under every ceiling. Set it to `0` to turn the rule
  off,
- touches a protected package — a built-in list, anything you add via `protected_packages`, **and**
  the OS's own essential flags where it has them (`dpkg`'s `Essential` / `Priority: required`).
  `unprotected_packages` is the escape hatch, and it wins over both,
- or trips one of the `[guard]` policy rules.

`shall protected` prints the effective rules, every ceiling included. The override for a
removal count is `--allow-mass-removal`, for an install count `--allow-mass-install`, and either
answers the total — a total is made of both. **`--yes` is deliberately not an override**, because every script and CI
job passes `-y`, and an unattended run is exactly the one that cannot notice a system being
taken apart. Protection is a refusal, not a confirmation: nothing overrides it.

## Your own conditions

`when` asks about facts Shall detects — `os`, `arch`, `family`, `host`. The `vars` file lets
you name your own, and `$` is how you tell the two apart:

```
# vars
role = desktop
gpu  = none

when host in [thinkpad, x220] {
  role = travel
}

when hostname == render-01 {
  role = workstation
  gpu  = nvidia
}
```

```
# modules/tools.txt
when $role == travel {
  apt:mosh
  apt:tlp
}
```

**Every variable needs a default at the top of the file.** A `when` block may override one but
never introduce it — otherwise `role` set only inside `when host == thinkpad` is undefined
everywhere else, and `when $role == travel` on your desktop has no answer. Requiring the
default means `$role` is defined on every machine and a typo is always an error, wherever you
are sitting. Shall enforces this by reading the whole file, not just the blocks that match here.

A value can be built from another variable, with `${}` where the name would otherwise run into
the next character:

```
role = render
tier = ${role}-heavy        # render-heavy
```

Order in the file does not matter; Shall resolves them in dependency order and tells you if two
variables define each other in a loop. Write `$$` for a literal dollar sign. A name never starts
with a digit, so `$1` in a value is left alone.

Two `when` blocks that both match and set the same variable to different values is an error
naming both lines — the same rule as two contradicting package declarations.

## Running a script

Some machine state is not a package or a file — enrolling a TPM, importing a keyring, running a
one-off migration. `exec:` declares a script the config carries:

```
exec:./bin/enroll-tpm.sh
```

**`exec:` is for actions with no inverse, not for installing software.** If you find yourself
writing `exec:` lines that install a package — shelling out to some manager Shall doesn't know —
that is the sign to teach Shall that manager instead: [a backend is six lines of
TOML](#teaching-shall-a-package-manager-it-has-never-heard-of), and then Shall can install,
*remove*, list and lock it like any other. An `exec:` that installs something is a one-way door:
deleting the line does not undo it, because a verb has no teardown. The onboarder gives you the
noun, which does. Reach for `exec:` when there is genuinely nothing to declare — a side effect,
not a resource.

**It runs once per distinct content.** Shall records the script's SHA-256 in `locks/exec.toml`
with a count. The next sync sees the same content at its ceiling and does nothing; edit one byte
and it is a different script, so it runs again. `@runs=3` raises the ceiling and
`@runs=always` opts out entirely — being explicit is the point, so nothing becomes a per-sync
command by accident.

**`@on=` says which verb runs it.** `sync` is the default; `upgrade` and `both` are the other
two. `shall upgrade` moves managed packages, which is the one thing a package manager can be
asked to do — everything else a machine needs brought forward is a command:

```
exec:./bin/firmware.sh   @runs=always,on=upgrade
exec:./bin/rustup-up.sh  @runs=always,on=both
```

Both lines above run under `shall upgrade`; only the second also runs under `shall sync`. A step
has to name `upgrade` to be run by it, and a line that says nothing runs on `sync` alone — so
adding this changed nothing about scripts you had already written. Approving a script says *this
content may run here*; it does not say *any verb may run it*, and that is a separate sentence you
write on the line.

**The common ones ship with Shall, so you write a name instead of a script:**

```
exec:step/rustup
exec:step/gcloud
```

That is the whole line. Each shipped step knows which verb it belongs to (`upgrade`) and that it
should run every time, so there are no options to remember — and a step whose tool is not on this
machine is skipped rather than failed, which is what makes one config work across a laptop and a
server. `shall check config` lists the names available here, and an unknown name is refused when
the config is read rather than when it runs.

**These need no `shall lock`, and your own scripts still do.** A shipped step is a row compiled
into the binary — a fact about a tool, not code your config carries — reviewed in Shall's own
repository and shipped with the rest of the program. The approval gate exists so that code
*travelling in your configuration* is read by a human before it runs; requiring you to approve
Shall's own rows as well would move that check somewhere it means nothing, and delete the reason
to have a catalogue at all. You approve what you wrote. You approved the rest by installing it.

`exec:step/fwupd` is the exception worth knowing about: it refreshes firmware *metadata* and
never flashes anything. A config file that writes your BIOS unattended on a weekly upgrade is not
a convenience, and no snapshot rolls that back — so if you want it, write the line yourself and
approve it.

**The condition is `when`, and there is no second condition system.** "Run this unless X" is a
variable your `vars` provider computes:

```
# vars.sh
tpm_enrolled = $(tpm2_getcap properties-fixed >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo yes || echo no)
```

```
when $tpm_enrolled == no {
  exec:./bin/enroll-tpm.sh
}
```

**A false `when` does not mean "undo".** This is the one place `exec:` differs from every other
statement, and it is deliberate: a script that succeeds makes its own condition false, so
treating false as removal would un-enrol the TPM on the very next sync and flap forever. A false
`when` runs nothing, undoes nothing, and **keeps the count** — so a condition that comes and goes
does not re-run the script each time it swings back.

**It is approved like any other code your repo runs.** `shall lock` approves a script at its
current hash; an unapproved or edited script stops the sync until you have looked at it, and
`-y` cannot approve. `plan` prints the hash, the run count and the decision before anything
happens:

```
Scripts:
  exec:./bin/enroll-tpm.sh  (modules/tools.txt:4)
    sha256:f7cba99726d4 — will run
```

**Removing the line runs `@undo=`, if you gave one:**

```
exec:./bin/enroll-tpm.sh {
  undo = tpm2_clear
}
```

Delete the line and Shall runs `tpm2_clear`, then forgets the script. Without an `@undo=`,
removing the line just drops the record — Shall cannot invent an inverse for a script, and
`plan` says so in those words rather than implying a revert that will not happen.

**A `when` going false is not a removal.** The line is still in your file, so nothing is undone;
that is what stops the enrol script un-enrolling itself on the very next sync. Only deleting the
line from the file counts, and deactivating a profile does not.

**One limit, stated rather than implied:** the hash covers the file Shall executes. A script that
sources another file, or curls one, changes behaviour without changing its hash, and Shall cannot
see that.

## The firewall

One line opens a port, and means the same thing on every machine:

```
firewall:22/tcp
firewall:default/incoming @value=deny
```

Shall drives whichever firewall the machine runs — `ufw`, `firewalld` or Windows Defender —
so the same config opens port 22 on a Debian laptop and a Windows workstation. A firewall Shall
does not know is a `[[firewall]]` row in `adapters/firewall.toml`, not a new release.

**A declared port is open; deleting the line closes it.** That is what declaring means, so
`firewall:22/tcp` takes no `@value=`. Only `default/incoming` and `default/outgoing` do.

**Shall will not close the port you are connected over.** Before any command runs, it checks
whether the change would cut the session it is being typed into — including the subtle case
where tightening `default/incoming` closes your port without ever naming it:

```
refusing to apply the firewall change: it would close port 22, which is carrying this session.
  Shall is being run over that port, so applying this would end the connection and leave no way
  back in.
  Declare `firewall:22/tcp` to keep it open, or make this change from the machine's own console.
```

That check runs on every path that can close a port — including an unattended `watch` tick,
which is the dangerous one, because nobody is there to read a refusal.

**Drift is corrected.** A rule someone added by hand is removed on the next sync, like any other
drift — with the one exception above. If your firewall is also configured by a `link:`ed ruleset
file, Shall warns that two things own the perimeter and lets your declared rules win.

## A folder of dotfiles

If your dotfiles already sit in a tree that mirrors `$HOME`, say so once instead of writing
forty `link:` lines:

```
dotfiles:./dotfiles
```

Every file under `./dotfiles` is linked to the matching place under your home directory —
`./dotfiles/.config/nvim/init.lua` becomes `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. `@target=` mirrors
somewhere else.

**Files, never directories.** Linking `~/.config/nvim` as a whole would take the directory
hostage: every cache, session file and plugin lockfile the app later writes lands inside your
git repo, and `bundle` would hand it to whoever gets the backup. So each file is linked
individually, and the directory stays yours.

**A destination that already holds your own file stops the run** — all of them at once, listed,
before anything is written:

```
3 destination(s) already hold a file Shall did not put there:
    /home/me/.bashrc
    ...
Nothing has been written. Move or delete them, or re-run with `--replace-existing`.
```

On a fresh machine those are usually untouched distribution defaults, which is what
`--replace-existing` is for. It is a per-run flag and deliberately not a config key: a machine
that always bypasses the check is one where the check does not exist.

**`--replace-existing` waives the stop, never the backup.** A tree is the `link:` lines it
stands for, so every file it replaces is preserved as `<destination>.shall-backup` first, the
same as a hand-written line. Delete a file from the tree and its link goes and your original
comes back; delete the `dotfiles:` line and that happens for the whole tree. The removals are
counted against the same ceiling every other removal is.

**The tree never decrypts.** A `.age` file in it is linked as the ciphertext it is — deciding by
file extension would be magic that silently writes plaintext. Secrets stay on explicit `link:`
lines where `@decrypt=` is written down.

**Several trees are fine** (`dotfiles:./work` under a `when`). Two trees that would place the
same destination is an error naming both.

## Secrets

**Your config repo can be public.** A secret is committed encrypted and decrypted onto the
machine at sync time, so what is in git is ciphertext and what your program reads is a normal
file with the plaintext in it.

```
link:./secrets/npmrc.age {
  target   = ~/.npmrc
  decrypt  = age
  identity = ~/.config/shall/age.key
}
```

`decrypt` takes `age` or `sops` — nothing else, and any other name is an error listing both.
Shall does not implement encryption; it runs the tool you already trust and writes what comes
back, byte for byte.

**The identity** is `@identity=` if you set it, else `$SHALL_AGE_IDENTITY`, else
`~/.config/shall/age.key`. `sops` reads its own configuration and ignores this.

```
# encrypt once, commit the .age file, never the plaintext
age -r age1ql3z... -o secrets/npmrc.age ~/.npmrc
```

Four things that follow from this being an ordinary declaration:

- **`when` works on it.** `when hostname == build-01 { link:./secrets/ci-token.age { … } }` is
  a secret that exists on one machine.
- **`--dry-run` never decrypts.** It tells you what it would write and stops, because a dry run
  that produced a plaintext file would be the leak.
- **Removing the line removes the plaintext**, the same as any other managed file.
- **The plaintext is restricted before it exists.** On Linux and macOS it is owner-only
  (`0600`); on Windows the file is created with inherited access stripped and only your account
  granted, using `icacls`. Either way the restriction is applied to a temporary file which is
  then renamed into place, so there is no moment when the destination holds a readable secret.
- **A `target` inside your config repo is refused.** The repo is git and `sync` commits it, so a
  plaintext there would be a plaintext in history — and a secret in history has to be rotated,
  not deleted. The error names the path and the repo.
- **No backup is taken for a secret.** For ordinary managed files Shall keeps your original as
  `<target>.shall-backup`; for a decrypted one it does not, because that copy would be the
  previous secret sitting in plaintext beside the new one.

Your `identity` key itself is never managed by Shall and never belongs in the repo. Shall's own
credentials work the other way round and are never files at all: `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read from the
environment, so a Shall config is always safe to hand to someone.

## History and rollback

With `shall git init`, your config directory is version-controlled and every sync commits.
History is git — there is no second generation store.

```bash
shall history            # browse commits, see what each changed, roll back from inside
shall diff HEAD~3        # what changed, in packages rather than text
shall rollback HEAD~3    # restore those manifests, then converge the machine to match
shall snapshot restore   # interactive snapshot gallery (btrfs / ZFS / Timeshift / Windows)
```

`rollback` refuses to apply unconfirmed in a non-interactive shell; pass `--yes` for CI.

Commits are made **as you** — Shall sets no git identity of its own and forces no signing flag,
so `commit.gpgsign` decides whether your history is signed. `shall git log` and `shall history`
show what git says about each commit's signature, and a signature git will not vouch for (an
untrusted, expired or revoked key) is never shown as a good one. Set `require_signed_history`
under `[guard]` to refuse a rollback to any commit git does not vouch for; it is off by default,
because a fresh repo signs nothing.

## Commands

### One command looks, one command acts

`shall check` answers every "what is going on" question — drift, unmanaged software, `absent:`
lines in force, conflicting declarations, backend health, known advisories, and whether any hook
you wrote is unapproved and so will silently never run. With no argument it
prints a line per section and names the command that acts on each:

```
ok  config      42 package(s) declared
->  drift       3 to install, 1 to remove
                   run `shall sync`
->  unmanaged   103 package(s) Shall does not manage
                   run `shall adopt`
ok  health      26 backend(s) ready
```

`shall check health` (or `drift`, `unmanaged`, `absent`, `conflicts`, `config`, `security`,
`approvals`) prints that section in full.

**`check` never changes anything.** What used to be `doctor --fix` — creating missing
directories, reconciling the lockfile, refreshing a stale backend index — is `shall heal`, along
with recovering an interrupted run. A command that both diagnoses and repairs is one you cannot
run to find out whether you want a repair.

Run `shall --help` for the full list with current wording, and `shall check health` for what this
machine actually supports — that is generated from the registry, so it cannot go stale the way
a number typed into a README does.

**Everyday**

| | |
|---|---|
| `sync` | Install, remove and update until the machine matches your files |
| `check` | Read-only: drift, unmanaged software, backend health — what needs you |
| `install` / `uninstall` | Edit the file and sync |
| `list` / `search` / `info` | What is installed, what exists, what a package is |
| `update` / `upgrade` | Refresh metadata; upgrade managed packages |
| `hold` / `unhold` | Stop a package from being upgraded |
| `rebuild` | Remove and reinstall what is declared, to repair what `sync` cannot see |

**Understanding the machine**

| | |
|---|---|
| `why` | Why a package is installed: where it is declared and what depends on it |
| `check config` | Parse everything the active profiles reach; report errors, change nothing |
| `check unmanaged` | What `shall adopt` would take: installed, you chose it, nothing declares it |
| `check absent` | Every `absent:` rule in force, and which module it comes from |
| `check conflicts` | The same tool pinned to different versions by different backends |
| `check health` | Per-backend readiness. It only reports — `shall heal` is what repairs |
| `path` | Print your config repo directory, so `cd $(shall path)` works. `--explain` says what decided it; `--set DIR` stores it |
| `edit` | Open the repo, or one file in it, in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` |

**Cleaning up**

| | |
|---|---|
| `adopt` | Write the packages you installed by hand into a module |
| `add` | Vendor someone else's modules into your repo from `github:owner/repo`, a git/file URL, or a path. Their code arrives unapproved until `shall lock` |
| `unmanage` | Stop managing a package **without** uninstalling it |
| `remove-orphans` | Remove what each manager considers orphaned — shows the list and asks first |
| `clean-cache` | Delete downloaded archives and caches; removes no installed package |
| `purge-undeclared` | Delete every installed package nothing declares — a wider set than `unmanaged`, because it includes the dependency closure. Shows the whole list first |

**Plan, lock, reproduce**

| | |
|---|---|
| `plan` / `apply` | Freeze what `sync` would do to a file, review it, then apply exactly that |
| `eval` | Print the resolved config as versioned JSON — every `when` decided, every bare name given a backend. Takes no locks |
| `try` | Rehearse this config on a clean machine in a container. Answers what `plan` cannot: would it work somewhere that is not here? |
| `lock` / `unlock` | Freeze what a sync would otherwise decide again — nine kinds, from version pins to `exec:` approvals. Scope it to a kind, a sub-category (`versions:apt`), or one name. **Recorded versions are replayed by every sync, not only `sync --locked`** — see below |
| `export` | Emit native manifests (Brewfile, requirements.txt, package.json, Aptfile) |
| `bundle` | An offline/air-gapped bundle of config, lockfile and resolved package list |
| `sbom` / `check security` | CycloneDX bill of materials; scan managed packages against OSV.dev |

**Running things**

| | |
|---|---|
| `shell` | An ephemeral shell with specific packages loaded, cleaned up on exit |
| `run` | One command in a throwaway environment |
| `watch` | Reconcile continuously (GitOps for one machine); unattended, applies without prompting |
| `schedule` | Native scheduled tasks (systemd, launchd, Task Scheduler) |
| `fleet` | Compare machines over SSH against your manifests and report drift |

`export` never silently overwrites: if `package.json` already exists, the export is written
beside it as `package.shall.json` and says so. `--force` overwrites deliberately.

### When `sync` says "nothing to do" and something is still broken

`sync` applies the *difference* between your files and the machine. A package that is declared
and installed but broken — a half-configured install, an interrupted download, a closure
something else removed — produces no difference, so `sync` will report success over it forever.

`shall rebuild` stops asking what changed and asserts the declared set from scratch:

```
shall rebuild fd ripgrep       one or more packages (cargo:fd picks a backend)
shall rebuild --backend cargo  everything that backend declares
shall rebuild --all            every declared package on this machine
```

There is no default scope — it removes software in order to put it back, so it makes you say
what. It works **one backend at a time**: all of that backend's packages come down together
(which is what actually lets a shared dependency become an orphan and get collected), then all
of them go back up, then the next backend. Backends that need root go first, because a crate can
need a system compiler and no system package has ever needed a crate.

It never touches undeclared software, and it never removes a protected package — those are
named and skipped rather than rebuilt. It cannot be put in `schedules`.

## Safety

- **Atomic transactions.** A write-ahead log records every mutation that cannot be recomputed —
  every package, every `exec:` script, every `@undo=` — before it runs, **whichever command
  issues it.** `sync`, `apply`, `upgrade`, `remove-orphans`, `purge-undeclared`, an expiring
  lease, a `shell` restore: they all write the record first, because being killed part-way
  through does not care which verb you typed. If Shall is killed mid-command, the next run
  heals it: packages are replayed or reverted, and an interrupted
  script is reported by name, because a half-run script has no recorded progress and re-running
  it would repeat the half that already ran. A crash that goes unattended for hours is still
  healable. Resources declared as an end state — a `service:`, a `setting:`, a `firewall:` rule,
  a placed `link:` — are not logged and do not need to be: the next sync reads the machine and
  finishes the job, which also corrects drift no log would have seen.
- **Snapshots.** btrfs, ZFS, Timeshift and Windows Restore Points, taken automatically before a
  sync or upgrade where a provider exists.
- **Dry run.** `shall --dry-run sync` previews without touching anything — and so does every
  other command, because the flag is honoured by the single function every file Shall owns is
  written through, not by each command remembering to ask. That includes `data/registry.json`,
  the record of what Shall manages: a preview that quietly recorded it would leave your packages
  managed and undeclared, which is the state the next `sync` reads as *remove all of these*.
- **Non-interactive refusals.** `sync`, `rollback` and `remove-orphans` refuse to apply
  unconfirmed changes in a pipe, cron job or CI run without `--yes`.

> **Filesystem-level rollback is Linux-first.** The pre-sync snapshot, `rebuild`'s revert and
> `rollback`'s safety net all depend on a snapshot provider — btrfs, ZFS or Timeshift on Linux,
> Windows System Restore on Windows. **macOS has no adapted provider yet**, so on macOS those
> commands run without a filesystem restore point: the git history still records every change
> and `shall rollback <commit>` still re-syncs packages, but there is no block-level undo. A
> health check that would revert (`@health=`) is *refused before the change* on a machine with
> no provider rather than run without a way back (see above), so this never fails silently.
- **Hooks are locked.** `after_install` and friends are hashed; a changed hook must be
  re-approved with `shall lock`, so a pulled config cannot quietly start running new code.
  - **A hook's first line picks its language.** A shebang runs it as a process in whatever it
    names; `#rhai` runs it in-process with Shall's own script library (`sh`, `read_file`, `env`,
    `http_get`, `parse_json`, the clock); anything else is Lua. All three are handed `PKG_NAME`,
    `HOOK_TYPE`, `OS` and `ARCH` — as `SHALL_`-prefixed environment variables for a process —
    and all three go through the same approval.
  - **A shebang works on Windows too.** Shall reads that first line itself rather than handing
    the file to the OS, which has no shebang mechanism of its own — so `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
    runs your Python on Linux, macOS and Windows alike. `python3` is looked up as `python` and
    `py` as well, because that is what a Windows install is usually called. An interpreter the
    machine does not have is refused by name, so a `#!/bin/bash` hook on a box without bash says
    which program is missing instead of failing as if the script were broken.
    ```toml
    [hooks.after_install]
    docker = '''
    #rhai
    sh("systemctl enable docker");
    '''
    ```
- **Hooks on Shall's own events.** Put a script at `hooks/after_sync`, `hooks/on_drift` or
  `hooks/on_guard_refusal` and it runs with the details on stdin as JSON — notify a channel,
  push the repo, open a ticket, without any of that having to become a Shall feature. The same
  three may live in `preferences.toml`'s `[events]` table for hooks that are this machine's business rather than
  the repo's; **both run**, so adding a local one never silently disables the shared one. They
  are locked like any other script, and one that fails warns without failing the sync.
  - **Slack, ntfy, webhooks, Telegram, paging — any channel — go through that hook, not a
    separate setting.** There is no `[[channel]]` block, because a hook already sends anything a
    `curl` can send, and two ways to do one thing is the thing this design removes. A copyable
    `hooks/after_sync` that posts to Slack:
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    # stdin is the event as JSON. The webhook URL is an ENV var, never the repo — a secret in
    # a committed file is a leaked secret (secrets are environment-only in Shall).
    payload=$(cat)
    curl -sf -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
      --data "$(printf '{"text":"Shall on %s: %s"}' "$(hostname)" "$payload")" \
      "$SHALL_SLACK_WEBHOOK"
    ```
    Approve it once with `shall lock` (it runs code, so the ledger gates it), and swap the
    `curl` line for ntfy, a Telegram bot URL, or a PagerDuty event — the mechanism is the same.
    The built-in `desktop`/`email` channels stay for the common case; everything else is this.
- **Health checks revert.** `apt:nginx@health=port:80` on a line, or a machine-wide
  `health = [...]` in `preferences.toml`. A failing check restores the snapshot the sync took
  before it started — and a health check declared on a machine with no snapshot provider is
  refused *before* the change, because telling you the machine broke without being able to put
  it back is worse than not checking.

### What has been driven, and what has only been argv-checked

Shall ships 63 backends. That counts the managers it drives by building a command line; `nixos:`
is a further one that works differently, by writing the system configuration instead. Either way
the number is what Shall *knows how to drive*, not a claim that every one has been driven — so
here is the difference, taken from the harnesses' own tables rather than from anybody's memory.

**Most of them get a real install → list → binary-on-PATH → remove round trip**, on every
nightly, against the actual manager: apt, dnf, pacman, apk, zypper, xbps and brew on their own
container image or runner, and cargo, npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, pip, pipx, uv, gem, go, composer,
opam, cabal, conda, mix, nix, spack, luarocks, nimble, helm, krew, pixi, dotnet, pub, mise,
scoop, winget, choco, github and web on the images that carry them. btrfs, LVM and ZFS run
against real loopback block devices on a privileged image.

**How many that is, measured rather than claimed.** Every sweep records how many backends
completed the full round trip, and `scripts/lifecycle-floor.txt` ratchets it: a run that does
worse than its host class has done before fails. The recorded floors:

| host class | backends round-tripped |
|---|---|
| `tools` image (the broad ecosystem sweep) | 28 |
| native Windows runner | 13 |
| `arch` image | 12 |
| `ubuntu` image | 10 |
| `fedora`, `void` images | 9 |
| native macOS runner | 8 |
| `alpine`, `opensuse`, `slackware` images | 7 |
| `guix` image | 3 |
| `storage` image (btrfs/LVM/ZFS on loopback) | 8 |

No single host runs them all, because no single host *has* them all — the Windows managers do
not exist on Linux and the reverse. These numbers may rise and never fall, and the table above
is checked against that file by the test suite, so it cannot drift the way the sentence it
replaced did.

**These are argv-tested only** — Shall builds the command line and a test asserts it is the
right one, and no machine in this project's CI has ever run it:

| backend | why nothing has driven it |
|---|---|
| `nixos` | no CI leg runs NixOS. The package round trip has been driven by hand on NixOS 26.05; the services-and-ports module has been evaluated and **built** into a real system closure there; and CI parses every generated module *and* merges it into a real NixOS module system. What no gate reaches is **activation** — that machine cannot activate at all, with or without Shall |
| `flatpak` | needs a session bus; the container matrix has none |
| `snap` | snapd is a systemd daemon, and no image here runs systemd |
| `macports` | never attempted: CI *does* run on `macos-latest`, and no step installs MacPorts on it. Work nobody has done, not hardware nobody has |
| `mas` | needs a signed-in Mac App Store account on real Apple hardware |
| `pkg`, `pkg_add`, `pkgin` | FreeBSD, OpenBSD and pkgsrc — no BSD host exists in this CI |
| `eopkg` | Solus publishes no container image |
| `emerge` | smoke-only: `gentoo/stage3` ships a binary-package host but no portage tree, so the closing move is a build-time `emerge-webrsync` nobody has paid for |
| `stack` | its toolchain can be baked in; the per-package source build cannot, so it is minutes per run for ever |

One code path is also unexecuted rather than untested: the `dpkg -i` / `rpm -U` local-file
handoff. An argv test proves a command line was constructed correctly. It does not prove the
manager accepts it.

**Storage removal used to be named here and no longer is, because it runs.** The `storage` leg
destroys a real object through Shall on every run and asserts it is gone — a btrfs subvolume, an
LVM logical volume, and as of 2026-08-18 a ZFS dataset, each on a loopback device. What is still
unexecuted is narrower and is the other half of `U30`: **no gate has ever marked a storage object
protected and watched the guard refuse to destroy it.** The guard's protection is tested over
package names, and a storage object is protectable by exactly that mechanism rather than a second
one — but a protected volume has never been put in front of a real `zfs destroy`.

### Exit codes

The same four everywhere, so a script can branch on them:

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | converged — what you declared is what is there |
| `1` | failed — something went wrong |
| `2` | differences — a read-only command looked and found work to do |
| `3` | refused — Shall said no, and there is no flag for it |

**`3` covers every refusal, not only the guard's.** Refusing to download over plain HTTP, to
install something with no `@sha256`, to write a secret the filesystem cannot protect, to decrypt
into the git repo, to run an unapproved hook, to overwrite a file Shall did not create, or to
place files outside `$HOME` all return `3` — the same code as refusing to remove too many
packages. A script can therefore tell "I refused" from "I broke" without reading the message, and
the `on_guard_refusal` hook fires for all of them.

**Including under `--keep-going`.** That flag carries the run past a refusal like any other
failure, and the run then ends by raising one summary over everything it carried past — which
used to report the whole run as an ordinary failure, so the same refused line exited `3` on its
own and `1` with the flag. A run whose every failure was a refusal is a refusal and still exits
`3`; one thing that genuinely failed and it is `1`, because something did fail.

`2` is why `shall check` in CI tells you a machine has drifted without failing the job the way an
error would, and `3` is distinct from `1` because "I will not do this" is not "this broke".

**`shall plan` exits `2` when the plan it wrote is not empty**, so a pipeline can branch on drift
using the command that also writes the artifact it will consume. `shall list --outdated`
deliberately exits `0` whatever it finds: a listing's subject is inventory rather than a verdict,
and one that failed for having contents would surprise every script that pipes it.

**`shall sync` exits `1` when a declaration could not be acted on** — one naming a manager this
machine cannot reach — counted per declaration, so a partial skip is caught too. This matters
most where nobody reads warnings: `sudo`'s stock `secure_path` hides `~/.cargo/bin`,
`~/.bun/bin` and `~/.local/bin`, so an unattended sync can install nothing and would otherwise
report success. A *removal the guard declines* is not this — that is the guard working, and it
is the ordinary state of every adopted machine.

## Teaching Shall a package manager it has never heard of

If a manager's CLI has plain install/remove/list verbs, Shall can learn it from data — no
Rust, no release. Write `adapters/backends.toml` in your repo:

```toml
[[backend]]
name   = "firewall"        # the prefix a line is written with
binary = "ufw"             # the program actually run; defaults to `name`
install_args = ["allow"]
remove_args  = ["delete", "allow"]
list_args    = ["status", "numbered"]
[backend.parser]           # how to read `list` output
format = "columns"
name_col = 0
```

`firewall:22/tcp` then works everywhere a built-in prefix works. Because `name` and `binary`
are separate, the prefix does not have to be a package manager's name — it can be any noun
that has a CLI behind it. And `binary` may be an absolute path (`/opt/vendor/tool`, `~/bin/x`),
not just a `$PATH` name — a missing one is a named diagnosis in `check health`, not a refusal.

**A custom backend is a full peer of a built-in** — the same optional keys the shipped
backends use are available to yours, and an absent key means *this backend cannot answer that*,
never *the answer is none* (so `re:` against a backend with no `enumerate_args` is refused, not
expanded to nothing):

```toml
[[backend]]
name = "mymgr"
install_args = ["add"]
remove_args  = ["rm"]
list_args    = ["list"]
# first-class extras, each optional:
essential_args   = ["essential"]         # what the removal guard must never take
enumerate_args   = ["list", "--all"]     # the catalogue `re:` expands against
depends_args     = ["deps"]              # a package's dependencies, for `packages` and `why`
repo_add_args    = ["repo", "add"]       # `repo:` lines
repo_remove_args = ["repo", "rm"]

**They live in the repo, so they travel**, which is the point: a definition on one machine
makes every other machine fail on a line it cannot resolve. And because each is a list of
commands your repo can run on any machine that clones it, each is approved the way a hook is —
`shall lock` approves them, and any later edit stops that file loading until you look at the
change and approve it again. **Each file is approved separately**: approving the backends you
added is not a review of the settings adapters.

**Overriding a built-in.** Custom definitions load last, and a name that is already taken is
skipped — being named `apt` is not a way to become `apt`. To replace one on purpose, say so:

```toml
[[backend]]
name = "apt"
overrides = true          # take the name from the built-in
binary = "apt-fast"
install_args = ["install", "--assume-yes"]
```

This is for the day a manager changes its CLI and Shall has not caught up yet: you can correct
it on your machines without waiting for a release. It costs two deliberate acts — the
`overrides = true` line, and `shall lock` approving the file — and neither one alone does
anything. Shall says so on every run that loads it, naming the backend and the program it now
runs, and `check health` then reports on *your* definition: if `apt-fast` is not installed, `apt`
is critical, because on this machine that is the truth.

Everything you teach Shall lives in one folder, one file per question:

```
adapters/backends.toml    how to drive a package manager Shall does not ship
adapters/settings.toml    how to read and write a settings store
adapters/bootstrap.toml   how to obtain a manager this machine does not have
adapters/prereq.toml      the setup a manager needs before it can install anything
```

**The last one is for a manager that is installed and still cannot install anything.** `mix`
needs Hex, `asdf` needs the plugin for the tool you named, `opam` needs a switch — each of them
fails every install until one command has been run. Shall ships those three and asks before
running any of them; `--yes` answers in advance, and a run with no terminal says what it would
have asked and changes nothing.

```toml
[[prereq]]
manager      = "mix"
missing      = "Hex, the package client `mix archive.install hex …` fetches through"
probe        = ["mix", "hex.info"]      # exit 0 means it is already there
run          = ["mix", "local.hex", "--force"]

[[prereq]]
manager      = "asdf"
missing      = "asdf's `{name}` plugin"
probe        = ["asdf", "plugin", "list"]
probe_output = "{name}"                 # this row reads OUTPUT: `asdf plugin list` exits 0
run          = ["asdf", "plugin", "add", "{name}"]   # `{name}` = once per declared package
```

**Its sibling teaches Shall a settings store.** `setting:` writes desktop configuration that
does not live in a file — GNOME's store via `gsettings` is shipped, and any other is a row in
`adapters/settings.toml`:

```toml
[[setting_store]]
name   = "kde"
detect = "kwriteconfig6"            # its presence means this machine runs this store
read   = ["kreadconfig6",  "--file", "{schema}", "--key", "{key}"]
write  = ["kwriteconfig6", "--file", "{schema}", "--key", "{key}", "{value}"]
reset  = ["kwriteconfig6", "--file", "{schema}", "--key", "{key}", "--delete"]
```

`@scope=user` (the default) or `@scope=system` chooses which store a setting goes to — `HKCU`
or `HKLM` on Windows, and the same word on every other store. Writing the default is fine; it
just says out loud what you would have got anyway. **A store with no machine-wide commands
refuses `@scope=system` by name** rather than quietly writing the per-user value, so a line
that says "every account" never silently applies to one. The same key works on `link:` and
`shim:`.

All three commands are required. Shall reads before it writes — that is what makes a setting a
declaration rather than a command that runs on every sync — and `reset` is what removing the
line does. A machine whose store has no row gets an error naming what Shall looked for, never a
key that silently did nothing.

`check` and `plan` read the store too, so a key already holding the value you declared is not
reported as work. Where the store cannot be read — a schema it does not know, a hive this
account cannot open — the key is reported as *unverifiable* rather than as drift, and applied:
Shall does not claim a machine matches a key it could not look at.

### The eight things you can teach it

Everything above is one of these. A row in one of eight files in your repo teaches Shall
something it does not ship, and a thing you teach it is a full peer of a thing it ships — the
built-in package managers go through the same table your `[[backend]]` row goes through, which
is the only reason that sentence is true rather than aspirational.

| file | row | teaches |
|---|---|---|
| `adapters/backends.toml` | `[[backend]]` | how to drive a package manager |
| `adapters/settings.toml` | `[[setting_store]]` | how to read and write a settings store |
| `adapters/init.toml` | `[[init]]` | how to drive an init system |
| `adapters/firewall.toml` | `[[firewall]]` | how to drive a firewall |
| `adapters/snapshot.toml` | `[[snapshot]]` | how to take and restore a filesystem snapshot |
| `adapters/secret.toml` | `[[secret]]` | how to decrypt a secret |
| `adapters/prereq.toml` | `[[prereq]]` | the setup a manager needs before it can install |
| `adapters/bootstrap.toml` | `[[bootstrap]]` | how to obtain a manager this machine lacks |

**`shall adapters` says what this machine has on each**, and the column that matters is the
last one:

```
SURFACE     ROW                STANDING     ROWS
backends    [[backend]]        in use       2
settings    [[setting_store]]  absent       -
init        [[init]]           absent       -
firewall    [[firewall]]       no rows      -
...
```

`no rows` is the one worth having a command for. A file can be present, approved and perfectly
valid TOML and still be doing nothing: write `[[backends]]` where the reader wants
`[[backend]]` and you have described a table nobody opens — no parse error, no warning, and a
`mymgr:` line that fails much later with a message about an unknown backend. `shall adapters
<surface>` narrows to one, and `--json` is the same answer for a script.

Every one of these files runs on your machine, so every one goes through the approval ledger:
the first `sync` after you write or change one refuses it by name and tells you to run `shall
lock`. That is the same rule hooks and `exec:` scripts follow, and it is why a repo you cloned
cannot teach your machine anything you have not read.

## Locking: what you can freeze, and how to say which

`shall lock` freezes **nine** separate things, and with no argument it freezes all of them:

| kind | what it freezes |
|---|---|
| `versions` | the installed version of every managed package |
| `backends` | which manager each bare name resolved to |
| `hooks` | lifecycle hooks (`after_install:nginx`) |
| `events` | hooks on Shall's own events |
| `adapters` | files under `adapters/` |
| `exec` | `exec:` scripts |
| `generate` | `generate:` commands |
| `health` | declared health-check commands |
| `vars` | the `vars` provider |

Three groups stand for sets of them: **`everything`**, **`packages`** (versions + backends), and
**`scripts`** (the seven that approve something the config can run).

Say what you want in whichever direction is shorter — a list, or everything minus the exceptions:

```sh
shall lock                            # everything
shall lock exec                       # just the exec: scripts
shall lock exec,hooks                 # two kinds
shall lock scripts                    # all seven approval kinds, no version pins
shall lock everything --except exec   # everything else
```

Four kinds divide further, written `kind:sub`, and a package name after that narrows again:

```sh
shall lock versions:apt               # apt's version pins, nobody else's
shall lock versions:apt curl          # apt's curl, and not cargo's
shall lock hooks:after_install        # one hook, across every package
shall lock everything --except versions:cargo   # all of it but cargo's pins
```

The other five are flat — an `exec:` script has no category above itself — so their granularity
is the item's own name: `shall lock exec ./setup.sh`. Asking for a sub-category where there is
none is refused and tells you so.

`unlock` takes exactly the same words. A scope you can freeze with and cannot release with is a
one-way door.

**The part worth knowing before you run it: a recorded version is replayed by every `sync`, not
only by `sync --locked`.** That is deliberate — a sync converges to what you decided, not to
whatever was published since — but it has a consequence that arrives weeks later. If the archive
drops a version you recorded, an ordinary `sync` starts failing on a version that is nowhere in
your config. Shall says so when that happens, and names the way out; these are the ways out:

```sh
shall upgrade curl              # move one package forward, and re-record its pin
shall upgrade --backend apt     # or a whole manager's worth
shall unlock versions curl      # drop one pin, take whatever the manager offers
shall sync --upgrade            # ignore every recorded pin, for this run only
```

For a standing preference rather than a per-run one, `preferences.toml` has a `[lock]` table
speaking the same vocabulary. Every default is the behaviour above, so leaving it out changes
nothing:

```toml
[lock]
freeze   = ["everything"]  # what a bare `shall lock` freezes
except   = []              # kinds left out of that
versions = ["*"]           # which managers get version pins
replay   = true            # does an ordinary sync install recorded versions
```

Prefer `except` to listing eight of the nine kinds: a tenth kind added later is still frozen by
`everything`, and would silently not be by a hand-written list. Set `replay = false` to keep the
lockfile as a record without it being an install argument — `check` still reports drift against
it, and `sync --locked` still reproduces from it exactly.

### How often the log is forced to disk

Shall keeps a write-ahead log so that a run killed part-way through can be finished rather than
guessed at. Opening an entry always reaches the disk before the package manager is invoked —
recovery cannot replay work it has no record of starting. Closing one is the half you can tune:

```toml
[journal]
flush_every = 32           # completed packages held before the log is forced to disk
```

The trade is small in both directions. A crash in the window between a package being installed
and its completion reaching the disk leaves an entry that says in-progress, so the next run
re-installs a package that is already there — which every manager Shall drives will take. The
cost of closing that window is a physical disk flush per package, in the middle of a wave, which
on a large config is the slowest thing in the run. Set `flush_every = 1` to flush every
completion if you would rather pay it.

## Configuration

`shall config init` writes a commented `preferences.toml` into your repo; `shall edit
preferences.toml` opens it and re-checks that it still parses when you save. Every key is
optional. Settings cover timeouts, concurrency (`max_parallel`), snapshot retention,
notification channels, the `[lock]`, `[journal]` and `[sync]` tables, and the `[guard]`
block that holds the removal rules described above.

**One of them is worth knowing about before you meet it.** `[sync] continue_past_transient`
is on, and it decides what happens when a package cannot be installed for a reason that is
not about your config — a held lock, a rate-limit window, a registry that rotated a signing
key. Shall finishes the rest of the plan, names what it could not do, and still exits
non-zero. It does *not* carry on past a package that does not exist, a refusal, or a failure
it could not classify: those say the plan itself is wrong, and the run ends there. Set it to
`false` if you would rather a plan were all-or-nothing.

Its neighbour `[sync] batch_recovery` decides what happens to the *other* packages on a failed
command line. Shall sends packages bound for the same manager in one command, because that is
much faster — and a manager fails a command as a unit, so one bad member would otherwise cost
the rest of the batch that run. The default, `bisect`, asks again about each half and opens only
a half that failed; it stops as soon as both halves fail, because one bad member can only be in
one half, so two failing halves means the manager itself is down.

**Where your repo lives is not a key in it.** `preferences.toml` sits *inside* the repo, so a
key there could only be read from the directory it was trying to move away from. That one
setting lives in Shall's own settings file, beside the repo rather than in it — set it with
`shall path --set DIR`, override it for one command with `--config-dir`, and ask which of the
four sources won with `shall path --explain`.

## Contributing

Start with **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the working agreement, the conventions that
are load-bearing rather than stylistic, and what review will ask you.

### Your first hour, in order

There are two large documents here and they are not alternatives —
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) is how to work, [`BUILDER.md`](docs/BUILDER.md) is what to
work *on*. Read them in this order and nothing below depends on something you have not met yet.

```sh
git clone … && cd shall
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # once per clone; it is NOT automatic, and a clone
                                      # that skips it has no pre-commit hook at all
cargo build --all-targets && cargo test --no-fail-fast
```

1. **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the working agreement. Ten minutes, and it is what
   review will hold you to.
2. **[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — where things live. Everything after this
   assumes it.
3. **[`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)** — build, test, and run Shall against a scratch
   config rather than against your own machine. Read
   [the verify chain](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#the-verify-chain) even if you skim the rest: four of its
   five steps see one platform of two, and the fifth is the one people skip.
4. **[`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md)** — the map of what is supposed to exist. Follow it to
   `spec/target-state.md` for the rules and `spec/why.md` for the bug each rule prevents. **Do not
   change a target-state rule without reading its `why` entry first.**
5. **[`docs/spec/decisions.md`](docs/spec/decisions.md)** — before you answer any question in code.
   A question with an ID in that register is the owner's, not yours.
6. **[`docs/TAKING-OVER.md`](docs/TAKING-OVER.md)** — *if you have inherited this rather
   than joined it.* Written for somebody who would rather not read Rust: how to read CI without
   `gh`, which failures are the ecosystem's rather than the code's, and the one-line edit that
   answers most red nightlies.
7. **[`docs/BUILDER.md`](docs/BUILDER.md)** — *last, and only when you are picking up work.* It is
   a standing work order (`B1`, `B2`, …), not an introduction: it opens mid-argument and assumes
   all five documents above. The newest `docs/GRADE-*.md` and `docs/HANDOFF-*.md` are its running
   commentary — the grade says what was found, the handoff says where the last session stopped.

The short version of the same thing:

| you want to | read |
|---|---|
| understand the code | [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| build, test, debug it | [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) |
| know what is supposed to exist | [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md), then `docs/spec/target-state.md` |
| know *why* a rule exists before changing it | `docs/spec/why.md` — every rule has an entry |
| find out whether a question is yours to answer | `docs/spec/decisions.md` |
| pick up outstanding work | [`docs/BUILDER.md`](docs/BUILDER.md), then the newest `docs/HANDOFF-*.md` |
| work out whether a red board is your problem | [`docs/TAKING-OVER.md`](docs/TAKING-OVER.md) |
| see what everything in `docs/` is for | [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) |
