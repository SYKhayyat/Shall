// remote hosts and SSH is configured non-interactively (keys/agent). Remote invocations
// are read-only unless you pass the flags that opt into changes.
//
// There is no `clone` command. It was removed, implementation and all, because copying the
// installed set without the intent produces a machine nobody can explain; `git clone` of the
// manifests plus `shall sync` is the supported path. Do not reintroduce it here.
