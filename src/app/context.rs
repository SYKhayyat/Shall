//! What one invocation of Shall is made of, and nothing else.

//! **`App` is a composition root, not a service.** It owns the collaborators a run needs, wires
//! them once, and hands out narrow views of itself — `Inventory`, `Declarations`, `Managers`,
//! `Leases`, the nine `apply` facets. It has no behaviour of its own, deliberately: every method
//! here is either construction or a one-line factory, so nothing can be written *on* `App` that
//! reaches twelve collaborators to use three.
//!
//! The rule that keeps it that way: **if it needs to decide something, it does not belong here.**
//! A method that reads `config` and asks `registry` a question is a facet; give it a type that
//! holds those two and can be built without an `App` at all.
