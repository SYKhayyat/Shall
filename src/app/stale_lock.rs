//! The package manager's own lock, left behind by a run that was killed (`Q50`).
//!
//! **The failure.** A sync is interrupted — Ctrl-C, a dead battery, a container torn down mid
//! transaction — and the manager underneath it dies with its lock file still on disk. From then
//! on *every* Shall run on that machine fails, with the manager's own words:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: failed to init transaction (unable to lock database)
//! error: could not lock database: File exists
//!   if you're sure a package manager is not already running, you can remove
//!   /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
//! ```
//!
//! Shall already says this well — it relays the advice and adds *"tried 4 times; the failure did
//! not change, so this is not the transient failure its output looks like"*. What it could not do
//! is act, and `heal` is the command whose entire job is *a run was interrupted, make this
//! machine workable again*.
//!
//! **Only locks whose existence IS the lock.** This is the distinction the whole module turns on,
//! and getting it wrong corrupts a package database:
//!
//! | manager | lock | may it be removed? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | pacman | `/var/lib/pacman/db.lck` | **yes** — created on start, removed on exit |
//! | dnf | `/var/cache/dnf/metadata_lock.pid` | **yes** — a pid file, removed on exit |
//! | zypper | `/run/zypp.pid` | **yes** — a pid file, removed on exit |
//! | apt / dpkg | `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`, `/var/lib/apt/lists/lock` | **NO** |
//!
//! apt and dpkg lock with `flock(2)` on files that exist permanently, whether or not anything
//! holds them. Their presence says nothing at all, the kernel drops the lock when the holder
//! dies, and deleting them removes the very files the next `apt` expects to lock. They are rows
//! in the same table rather than a second list beside it: a row that says *why it may never be
//! removed* travels with the paths it is about, and cannot be re-admitted by someone extending
//! the table who never read the other one.
//!
//! **Staleness is proved, never assumed.** A lock carrying a pid is stale when that pid is not
//! running. A lock carrying nothing is stale when no process of the owning manager is running at
//! all. Neither question is asked on a platform that has no `/proc`, and every one of these
//! managers is Linux-only, so elsewhere this module finds nothing and says nothing.
//!
//! **And the other half of the same knowledge: waiting.** A lock that a *live* manager holds is
//! not a defect at all — it is the ordinary case of two package managers on one machine, and the
//! only thing that helps is to wait for the one that got there first. Shall used to retry four
//! times over three and a half seconds and then tell the user *"this is not the transient failure
//! its output looks like"*, which was false in exactly the case it was printed. [`held_for`]
//! answers which of the three states the machine is in, so the retry loop can wait, refuse, or
//! send the user to `heal` — and say something true in each case.
