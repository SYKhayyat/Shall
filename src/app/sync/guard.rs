//! The removal guard: the last check between a plan and a purged system.
//!
//! Drift removal is derived from managed state, and managed state can be wrong — a
//! mis-scoped manifest, a bad adoption, a state file from another machine. When it is
//! wrong the planner does not produce a *small* mistake; it schedules every managed
//! package for removal and the engine carries it out one purge at a time.
//!
//! Two rules shape this module:
//!
//! 1. *Every* path that deletes is guarded, not just the reviewed ones. A guard on one
//!    command is a guard on nothing: the bug that motivated this arrived through `prune`,
//!    which nobody thought to check.
//! 2. `--yes` never overrides it. `-y` means "don't ask me questions", which every script
//!    and CI job passes; it must not also mean "yes, purge the system". The dedicated
//!    `--allow-mass-removal` is the only override, and it cannot be set permanently in
//!    config.

/// Proof that this guard was consulted, and the only thing an effector will remove without.
///
/// **`README.md:358` promises that every path removing anything goes through one guard. Until
/// this type existed, that sentence was checked by a regex over source text** —
/// `removal_guard_enumeration_tests.rs`'s `is_removal_call`, matching `.remove(` with `sudo`
/// on the line, `.remove_repo(`, `.remove_shim(` and `.deprovision(`. `apply/firewall.rs` closes
/// a port with `deny_command`, which matches none of them, and the word `guard` appears nowhere
/// in that file. **The fix for `G-1` replaced a stale list of paths with a stale list of verbs**,
/// and the staleness moved into a predicate with a passing self-test, where nobody re-derives it.
///
/// So the enumeration is the compiler's now. Every effector that removes takes one of these, and
/// the only way to get one is to have asked. Effector six is covered by construction rather than
/// by someone remembering the list.
///
/// This is what `PlanScope` did for planning, applied to removal. `planner.rs` states the
/// technique better than this comment can: *"the case that reaps cannot be written without the
/// list that bounds it."*

/// error, so the token cannot be minted by a caller who would rather not ask.

    // exit 3 and five protections — `tar`, `sed`, `grep`, `gzip`, `findutils`. The mutant was
    // silent, exited 1, and attempted the removal. **The machine survived only because apt
    // refuses to remove its own `Essential: yes` packages** — a second line of defence Shall
    // does not own, does not check for, and cannot assume of every backend.
    //
    // **Nothing in this repository caught it.** Not the 1,814 lib tests, not the 535
    // integration tests, and not the 425-check container harness — the mutant binary swept the
    // `tools` image at 424 pass / 1 fail, the same single failure the clean binary has. Even
