//! Running the scripts attached to Shall's own events (XIII.13, U15).
//!
//! **Two locations, and both run (U15, ruled 2026-07-24).** A hook may live in the config
//! repo's `hooks/` directory — the policy every machine should run, committed and shared — or
//! in `preferences.toml`'s `[hooks]` table, which is where a machine keeps the notification
//! that talks to *its* Slack. The two kinds of hook are genuinely different, and forcing them
//! into one file makes one of them wrong.
//!
//! **Additive, never overriding.** Both fire, repo first. A precedence rule would mean that
//! adding a local notification silently disables the shared policy, which is the quiet failure
//! this whole model exists to avoid.
//!
//! **A failing hook warns; it does not fail the sync.** The sync's job is the machine's state,
//! and it succeeded or it did not — a Slack webhook that is down does not change that. The
//! inverse (a hook that can fail a converged sync) would make every integration a new way for
//! `sync` to break.
//!
//! **Approved before it runs, like everything else the repo can execute (II.12).** Same ledger,
//! same rule, no exception for "it's only a notification".
