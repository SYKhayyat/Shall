// Snapshot bisect: given the ordered list of snapshots (oldest -> newest) and a
// test command whose success means "good", find the first snapshot where the test fails —
// i.e. the change that introduced a regression.
//
// The binary-search core (`first_bad`) is a pure function so it can be unit-tested against
// a synthetic oracle. The command wraps it with a real oracle that restores each candidate
// snapshot and runs the user's test. Filesystem-restore backends (btrfs/timeshift) may
// require a reboot to activate a restore, so this fully automates only where restore is
// immediate (e.g. ZFS rollback); elsewhere it clearly reports the step it reached.
