//! A package that installed and cannot be run.
//!
//! `shall install pub:sass` succeeds, `shall list` agrees, and typing `sass` answers "command
//! not found" — because `~/.pub-cache/bin` is not on `PATH` and nothing ever said so. Shall
//! reported success for a package the user cannot invoke, which is the same event as a failed
//! install everywhere it matters and is reported as the opposite.
//!
//! Every per-user ecosystem has this shape: the manager installs into a directory under `$HOME`
//! and leaves putting it on `PATH` to you. System managers do not — `apt` writes to `/usr/bin`,
//! which is on every `PATH` by definition — so this says nothing about them.
//!
//! One place and one check on the shared path, not a check per backend. Eleven copies of a
//! `~/.x/bin` string is eleven chances to disagree, and the eleventh is the one that stays
//! wrong.
//!
//! **A convention is only usable where there is one.** The first version of this file cleared
//! `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm`/`bun` as "they shim into a directory their own installer wires up", and
//! CI falsified that for yarn on 2026-07-29 — an install that passed `list` and left the binary
//! unreachable. Those managers are asked instead, because the answer is decided by how the
//! manager itself was installed and no constant is right on two machines.
