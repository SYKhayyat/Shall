//! `locks/bare.HOST.toml` — which package manager an unpinned name resolved to (II.6).
//!
//! A line that does not pin one manager (`ripgrep`, or `apt,dnf:ripgrep`) is answered by
//! asking its candidates in order whether they have that name and taking the first yes (II.7
//! step 4). Unrecorded, that answer is re-derived every run against whatever is installed
//! *now* — so adding a package manager that sits higher in `priority` and happens to publish
//! the same name silently changes what an unedited line means. The record is the fix: asked
//! once, then the same answer until you say otherwise.
//!
//! **One file per host.** Which manager has `ripgrep` is a fact about a machine, and
//! `locks/` travels with the config to every machine that shares it. A single file would
//! hold whichever answer synced last: the Ubuntu box writes `apt`, the Fedora box overwrites
//! with `dnf`, and the two rewrite each other on every sync and collide in git forever. A
//! file per host means each machine writes only its own, every file commits cleanly, and
//! each machine still reproduces exactly what it had.
//!
//! **Deleting is how you unfreeze** (II.15's rule, applied here): an entry means frozen, no
//! entry means ask. `shall unlock backends` removes entries; so does an editor, because the file is
//! yours.
//!
//! One file per host rather than one per backend, unlike the rest of `locks/`: the fact
//! recorded is about a *name*, and a name that moves backends would otherwise be two writes —
//! a delete from one file and an insert into another — for one fact changing.
