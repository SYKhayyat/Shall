//! One mechanism for every adapter table (K17).
//!
//! **K17's ruling was applied seven times and implemented seven times.** "Adapters are a table,
//! and the built-ins are rows in it" is the reason `setting:` reaches a store nobody wrote an
//! arm for — and firewalls, init systems, snapshot providers, bootstrap commands, prereq setup
//! steps and secret providers each went on to make the same move separately. Seven row types is
//! correct: a firewall's argv is `allow`/`deny`, an init's is `start`/`stop`, a settings store's
//! is `read`/`write`/`reset`, and folding those into one schema would be a struct with twenty
//! optional fields. Seven copies of the *machinery around* them is not.
//!
//! What was written seven times: the `os` filter, the floor a row has to clear to be acted on,
//! the "shipped rows then the user's" merge, the "which row describes this machine" search, and
//! `{placeholder}` substitution. Four of the five had already drifted:
//!
//! - **`[[secret]]` had no `os` field at all** while every one of its six siblings did, so the
//!   one table whose rows hand a command a plaintext secret was the one that could not be
//!   restricted to the platform it was written for.
//! - **Three tables refused a duplicate name and three did not**, so whether a second row
//!   claiming a name was reported or silently kept depended on which table it was in.
//! - **The `os` question had two spellings** — `applies_to_this_os()` reading
//!   `std::env::consts::OS` and `applies_here(os)` taking it as a parameter — which is two
//!   answers to one question and no way to test the first.
//! - **The floor was seven near-copies**, agreeing on the first check and diverging after it.
//!
//! A row now says what it is (`name`, `only_on`, `why_unusable`) and this module answers
//! everything asked *about* rows. Adding an eighth table means implementing three methods, not
//! copying a loader.
