//! How long a command may take before Shall says so.
//!
//! Nothing measured latency, which is how a 98-second `shall info cargo:ripgrep` shipped —
//! answering `not found in any available backend` about a package `shall search ripgrep` found
//! in the same tree, seconds later (E14/E15). W14 fixed that one `info`; the budget it asked
//! for was never built, so nothing would notice the next one.
//!
//! **The split is diagnostic, not arbitrary.** Measured on Windows with 24 ready backends,
//! debug build, a fixture with 111 adopted packages:
//!
//! ```text
//! policy / vars / eval / check config        0.13 – 0.32 s
//! list                                       3.4  – 3.9  s
//! check health                               4.3  – 5.4  s
//! check                                      8.5  – 18.3 s
//! ```
//!
//! A command that only reads files is fast on every machine. A command that asks every manager
//! costs whatever the managers cost, and that is a fact about the host rather than about Shall.
//! So the budget is per **class**, and only the two classes whose cost Shall controls carry a
//! hard one.
//!
//! **The numbers are ceilings a collapse crosses, not targets.** A budget tight enough to
//! police 3 seconds against 5 on a shared CI runner is a gate that goes red on load, and a gate
//! that goes red on load is a gate people learn to ignore — `lifecycle-floor.txt` says the same
//! thing about guessed constants. These are set an order of magnitude above what was measured,
//! so what crosses them is the 98-second shape and not a busy afternoon.
