//! Work that blocks a thread, run from a command that is `async`.
//!
//! **Shall's slowest waits are not on the network — they are on a person, or on a program.** A
//! confirm sits at a prompt until someone types; a TUI reads keys for as long as they browse;
//! `git commit` runs after every sync; a `btrfs subvolume snapshot` takes as long as it takes.
//! Every one of those was a plain blocking call reached straight from an `async fn`, which parks
//! a tokio worker for the whole of it. One worker of several is survivable rather than fatal,
//! which is exactly why it lasted this long — and why the next one was written the same way.
//!
//! Two shapes, two primitives:
//!
//! * [`on_the_terminal`] — waiting where the call cannot move: it owns the terminal, or its
//!   caller is synchronous. `block_in_place` moves the runtime's other tasks off this worker and
//!   lets the call stay where it is. [`command_output`] and [`command_status`] are that, spelled
//!   for the `std::process::Command` sites.
//! * [`off_the_runtime`] — work that *can* move, because nothing about it is tied to this
//!   thread: unpacking an archive, hashing a file, waiting out a file lock. That belongs on the
//!   blocking pool, where it neither parks a worker nor competes with one.

/// Wait where the call cannot move, without parking a runtime worker.
///
/// `block_in_place` panics on a current-thread runtime, and Shall builds one of those as a
/// fallback in `rhai_stdlib`, so the flavour is asked rather than assumed. Nothing reaches a
/// prompt from there today; a check that costs nothing is cheaper than a panic that depends on
/// that staying true — and cheaper still than one that only fires for whoever writes the hook
/// that does reach it.
