//! What each manager has installed, asked once per run.
//!
//! Answering "is `jq` installed?" by listing every package the manager has is what nearly every
//! backend in this tree does — `info` is `list_installed()` plus a `find` in eighteen of them —
//! and the callers ask it once per *declared* package. Measured on Windows, `shall check drift`
//! cost ~247 ms more for every additional declaration, on a command whose whole job is to
//! compare two lists it could have fetched once. On Ubuntu the same shape produced exactly
//! `declared + 1` `dpkg-query` invocations.
//!
//! The listing is the same answer every time within one command, so it is fetched once and
//! reused. A mutation is the one thing that can change it, and every mutation goes through
//! `CommandExecutor::run`, which forgets these.
//!
//! **Per executor, not per process.** Every backend of one `App` shares that `App`'s executor,
//! so the memo is scoped to the run — which is also what keeps one test's mock listing out of
//! the next test's, in a suite where a hundred `App`s live in one process.
//!
//! **And optionally per machine, across runs** (`installed_cache_secs`, off by default). Asking
//! once per run is the whole win while a run lasts; the next `shall list` still pays ~3.2 s to
//! ask 24 managers the same question about a machine nothing has touched. The disk layer sits
//! behind this same seam, so a backend cannot tell the difference and no caller had to change.
