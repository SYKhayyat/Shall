//! What a download-shaped backend actually resolved to: `locks/<backend>.toml` (VIII.2, D6).
//!
//! A version is not the identity of a downloaded artifact. `github:sharkdp/fd@version=10.2.0`
//! names one release and that release ships a `.deb`, an `.rpm`, a `.tar.gz` and a bare
//! binary — so a lock recording only the version leaves the artifact free to change under a
//! pinned declaration, which is the bug Part VIII exists to close.
//!
//! The hash is here rather than in the declaration because one hash cannot cover an asset that
//! varies by machine (D6): a shared module says `github:x/y` and the Ubuntu box downloads the
//! `.deb` while the Fedora box downloads the `.rpm`. A per-machine record can describe both; a
//! hand-written `@sha256=` cannot describe either without pinning the format first.
//!
//! **A recorded hash is a record, not a policy.** It says what was downloaded, so a change is
//! visible in `shall diff` and a re-download that differs is an error. It does not demand that
//! the user pre-declare anything.
