//! What `lock` and `unlock` can freeze, one name per thing, and how a person selects a set.
//!
//! **There were three axes and there are nine kinds, because the granularity was already there.**
//! `scripts` was one word covering seven separately-approved things — a hook, an event hook, an
//! adapter file, an `exec:`, a `generate:`, a health-check command and a `vars` provider — each
//! of which already has its own identity in `locks/hooks.toml` and its own prefix in that
//! identity. Approving all seven to approve one was not a limitation of the ledger. It was a
//! limitation of the word.
//!
//! **Below the kind there is a sub-category, spelled `kind:qualifier`.** `versions:apt` is apt's
//! pins, `hooks:after_install` is one hook across every package, `events:before_sync` is one
//! event wherever it is declared. Four of the nine kinds have such a division and five do not —
//! an `exec:` script has no category above itself, only its own name — and asking for one where
//! none exists is refused rather than silently matching nothing.
//!
//! **Why the scope is a word and not a flag.** `--backend apt` reads well until you want
//! `--except`, and then it cannot be written at all: an exclusion is a list, and a flag applies
//! to the whole command. "Everything except cargo's pins" is `--except versions:cargo` and has
//! no spelling as a flag. One mechanism that works in an include list, an exclusion and
//! `preferences.toml` identically beats two that each work in one place.
