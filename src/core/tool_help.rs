//! Ask a manager what it accepts, instead of assuming.
//!
//! E11's fix was `--verify=false`, taken from helm's own error text on the machine where the
//! bug was reported. That machine ran helm v4.2.3, which has the flag. helm 3 does not, and
//! rejects it outright:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: `helm` failed (exit 1): Error: unknown flag: --verify
//! ```
//!
//! So `@unverified` worked on helm 4 and broke every helm 3 — one argv defect traded for
//! another, from a fix derived from one machine's error message and shipped unconditionally.
//!
//! The lesson is not "check helm's version". A version table is the same assumption with a
//! number in it, and it goes stale the same way. **Ask the tool.** `--help` is the one argument
//! no package manager acts on, which is why the argv-drift gate uses it too.
