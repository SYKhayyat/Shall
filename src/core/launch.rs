//! **B-1 lived here.** The `.cmd` arm built `cmd /C <script> <args…>` by hand under a comment
//! saying `cmd` forwards arguments cleanly. It does not — it parses `&`, `>`, `<`, `|` and `^`
//! out of its own command line first — so a package name of `q&calc.exe&rem` reaching a `.cmd`
//! shim ran `calc.exe`. Meanwhile the validator's doc comment carried the safety argument for
//! the whole program: *"no package-manager command is ever a shell string — every one is
//! argv."* True everywhere except this file. The two facts never met, because nothing put them
//! in the same place.
