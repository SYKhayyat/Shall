// half and the complementary one: the human-readable, diffable, branchable, pushable history
// of what you *asked for* (II.13). `git diff` shows "you added ripgrep, removed nano"; a
// remote backs your whole setup up like dotfiles. There is no generation format; a generation
// IS a commit.
//
// This is a thin, dependency-free wrapper that shells out to the system `git` (Shall already
// shells out to every package manager, so this adds no new dependency and no libgit2 build
// cost). Every method that could fail on a machine without git returns a `Result` the caller
// can degrade gracefully on — auto-commit, for instance, simply no-ops when git is absent.
//
// The repo root is the Shall config directory, so a single repo captures `preferences.toml`,
// `modules/`, `profiles/`, `active`, `priority` and `locks/` together.
