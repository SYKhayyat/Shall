//! Asking a human, in the one place that knows nobody may be there.
//!
//! Six call sites wrote the same three steps: honour `--yes`, check `stdin().is_terminal()`,
//! then `dialoguer::Confirm::new().default(false).interact()`. The steps are not the
//! interesting part — **the third answer is**. A confirm has three outcomes, not two: yes, no,
//! and *there is nobody to ask*, and every copy of these three steps got to decide the third
//! for itself. `snapshot_restore`'s gallery decided it by not deciding, and answered a restore
//! with `dialoguer`'s bare `IO error: not a terminal`.
//!
//! There are two right answers to *nobody is there*, and which one a site wants is the only
//! thing it has to say: refuse by name, or decline and carry on. Both are spelled out at the
//! call site because both are a policy about the machine, not a detail of the prompt.
