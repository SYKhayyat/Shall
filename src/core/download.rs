//! The rules a remote download obeys before anything it produced reaches your PATH (SEC2).
//!
//! `web:`, `appimage:` and `github:` all do the same three things: fetch a URL, mark the
//! result executable, and put it on `PATH`. That is a code-execution path with the network on
//! the other end of it, so **HTTPS and a checksum are the default and each relaxation is an
//! explicit, separate flag on the line that needs it**:
//!
//! - `@allow_http` — the URL may be `http://`.
//! - `@unverified` — no `@sha256` is required.
//!
//! **They never imply each other.** Allowing plain HTTP for a host that only serves HTTP must
//! not silently also drop the checksum: that combination is precisely the one where the
//! checksum is doing the most work, because anyone on the path can rewrite the response.
//!
//! *Why per-line and not a config key:* a global "require checksums" switch gets turned off
//! once, by the first person who meets a publisher that does not publish hashes, and never
//! gets turned back on — leaving a system that looks protected and is not. A flag on the line
//! has to be written for each spec that needs it, and it stays in the file where the next
//! reader sees it.
