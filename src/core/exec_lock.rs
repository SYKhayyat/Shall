//! `locks/exec.toml` — how many times a given script *content* has run here (XIII.3).
//!
//! `when` decides whether the machine wants a script. It cannot decide whether the script
//! already happened: variables are resolved once and frozen into the plan (W4/W13), so a
//! condition the script itself would falsify is still true within the run that executes it.
//! That is what this ledger is for.
//!
//! **The hash is the identity, not the path.** Editing a script makes it a different script,
//! so it runs again; renaming it does not. Same reasoning II.12 uses for artifacts: what you
//! declared is the content.
//!
//! **A row is never dropped for a `when` that went false.** Dropping it would make a condition
//! that flaps — a laptop on battery, a host that comes and goes — re-run the script every time
//! the condition swung back true, because the count would have been forgotten. The count means
//! *"this content has run n times on this machine"*, full stop.
