//! One connection pool per policy, for the life of the process.
//!
//! A `reqwest::Client` **is** the connection pool, the TLS session cache and the resolver
//! cache. Eight places in this tree built one per request, so every OSV advisory GET, every
//! registry query and every asset download paid a full TCP handshake, a full TLS handshake and
//! a re-parse of the root store — to a host the previous request had just finished talking to.
//! Clients built here are cached by the policy that distinguishes them, and cloning one is an
//! `Arc` bump, so a caller that asks per request still gets the same pool.
//!
//! The key is the whole policy and not just the user agent: a client that would follow an
//! HTTPS→HTTP redirect must never be handed to a caller that refuses one (SEC2), and a client
//! with no timeout must never be handed to an API call.
