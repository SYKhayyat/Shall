//! The one Rhai Shall ships — the engine and the standard library on it.
//!
//! Two places run Rhai: `vars.shall` (Part IX) and a `#rhai` hook (II.12). They are the same
//! trust — II.6b ruled `vars.shall` is *"trusted the same as a hook — a script in your own
//! repo"* — so they get the same language. They used to get different ones: `vars` had the
//! clock, a shell, files, the environment and the network, and a hook had `print`. That was
//! never a security posture (a hook two lines away in the same config can open `#!` and run
//! anything), it was a gap, and it made the shipped example config's `exec("systemctl enable
//! docker")` a call to a function no engine here had ever registered.
//!
//! **What makes this safe is the ledger, not the engine.** Every script either engine runs is
//! hashed into `locks/` and gated by II.12: first sight asks, a changed hash stops, and `-y`
//! cannot skip it. Withholding a shell from one arm stopped nobody and hid that.
