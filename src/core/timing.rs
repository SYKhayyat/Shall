//! Where a run's seconds went, per child command.
//!
//! [`latency`](crate::core::latency) measures the *total* and says when it crosses a budget.
//! That is enough to notice a 98-second `info` and not enough to act on one: the next question
//! is always which manager took the time, and until this existed the only way to answer it was
//! to time the managers by hand outside Shall and subtract.
//!
//! **Sum and wall clock are both reported, because their ratio is the parallelism.** Shall
//! spends its life waiting on other people's processes, so a run whose child time sums to 6 s
//! inside a 3.4 s wall clock is overlapping them 1.8×, and one whose ratio is 1.0 is asking
//! them one at a time. A breakdown that printed only the sum would hide the difference the
//! whole design turns on.
//!
//! Recording is off unless `--timings` asks for it: the lock is uncontended and the cost is a
//! `String` per child, but a measurement nobody requested is exactly the eager work this
//! module exists to find.
