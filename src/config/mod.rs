/// Notepad writes UTF-8 **with** a BOM by default, and so does PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content

/// them — so before this they became part of the first name on the first line, and the refusal
/// named two strings that render identically (`` `cargo` is not a backend Shall uses — add
/// `cargo` to your `priority` file ``).

/// nothing but a paste puts there, and the validator still refuses it by name. Stripping every
