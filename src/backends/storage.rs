//! Declared storage objects: ZFS datasets and LVM logical volumes, one family (U30).
//!
//! `btrfs:` already declares a btrfs subvolume as an object; a ZFS dataset (`zfs create`) and an
//! LVM logical volume (`lvcreate`) are the same idea — a declared, sized, mounted storage object
//! — so they are one family rather than three unrelated backends. They are Rust rather than a
//! `ManagerConfig` because they are not argv-with-`{name}={version}`: a volume has a size and a
//! mountpoint, not a version.
//!
//! **The safety edge U30 turns on: a `remove` here destroys a filesystem and everything on it.**
//! `zfs destroy` and `lvremove` are not "uninstall a package"; they are "erase a disk". Both are
//! ordinary backends, so their removals run through the **normal** sync guard with no special
//! escalation — which is exactly the point: a declared volume is protectable like a package
//! (`[guard] protected_packages` matches `zfs:tank/data`), it counts against `max_removals`, and
//! deleting the line previews the destruction before the guard lets it proceed. A storage backend
//! that ran its own removal outside the guard would be the teleport bug (V-lesson 2026-07-17) with
//! a filesystem on the end of it.
