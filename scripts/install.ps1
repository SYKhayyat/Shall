# WHICH Shall — the twin of install.sh's rule. `HEAD` is whatever was pushed last, which is not
# a thing anyone can ask for twice. The default is the newest release tag; $env:SHALL_REF
# overrides it, and a repo with no tags falls back to the branch and says so.
#
# **`git` is optional here and the twin already knew that.** `cargo install --git` fetches over
# libgit2 and needs no `git.exe`, so a Windows box with Rust and no Git can install Shall
# perfectly well — but `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` turns a missing command into a
# terminating `CommandNotFoundException`, and this script died on it with a raw stack trace at
# the one step that is only ever a *preference*. `install.sh` degrades: its `git ls-remote`
# failure is swallowed by the pipeline's exit status and the branch fallback takes over.
# Exactly the twin-that-diverged shape CLAUDE.md is about — the rule is in both files now.
#
# **A branch is not a tag, and cargo is told which - the twin of the same rule in install.sh.**
# SHALL_REF is documented above as "tag or branch" and was passed to `--tag` either way, so the
# branch spelling could not work: `cargo install --git X --tag main` asks libgit2 for
# `refs/remotes/origin/tags/main` and is told NotFound. Both nightly install jobs run the
# documented line with SHALL_REF=main; this is the one the Windows job died on.
