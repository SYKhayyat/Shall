# release-check.sh — the single "am I ready to ship?" gate for Linux/macOS.
#
# Runs, in order, everything a release must pass and prints one go/no-go verdict:
#   1. HERMETIC gates (any host, fast, no Docker):
#        cargo fmt -- --check       (HARD)
#        cargo clippy -D warnings   (HARD)
#        cargo test --release --no-fail-fast   (HARD — all unit/integration tests)
#        cargo build --release      (HARD)
#   2. REAL integration matrix (needs Docker on Linux): every distro image + the broad `tools`
#        image, each doing real install→list→remove for every feasible backend, full feature
#        coverage, and a self-checking coverage audit. On macOS (no Docker for Linux images)
#        this step runs the native sweep instead.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release-check.sh                 # full: hermetic gates + Docker matrix (incl. gentoo)
#   SKIP_DOCKER=1 ./scripts/release-check.sh   # hermetic gates only
#   DISTROS="ubuntu tools" ./scripts/release-check.sh   # subset of images
#
# Exit code is non-zero if any HARD gate failed — wire it straight into CI or a pre-release hook.
