#
# **The survivor ceiling is a RATE, in permille, and it used to be a count.** A count cannot tell
# a harness that grew from one that got weaker, and on 2026-08-16 it stopped both harnesses for
# growing. The container harness went from 92 survivors of 136 checks to 120 of 198 — 62 new
# checks, of which 34 catch a do-nothing binary — and the gate reported the 120 and failed. The
# Windows harness did the same, 86 of 120 to 90 of 139, and was over its budget on a clean tree
# while green on the runner.
#
# The growth is the legitimate kind this file's own header describes two paragraphs down: an
# `lx -y sync` exit-code check paired with the assertion that looks at the effect, and
# preconditions like "no shim exists before the sync that deploys it". Each pair adds one
# survivor AND one catch, so it moves a count and leaves a rate where it was. A weakening does
# the opposite — it adds a survivor with no catch beside it, or turns a catch into a survivor —
# and moves the rate every time.
#
# **What a rate buys and what it costs, so the next person does not have to rediscover it.**
# It costs the strictest reading: adding 100 strong checks buys room for a few weak ones, which
# a count would have refused. That trade is deliberate. A count refused the weak ones and the
# strong ones alike, so the only way past it was to stop adding checks — and a gate whose
# cheapest satisfying move is "write no more tests" is worse than the leak it plugs. The half
# that cannot be traded away is `CAUGHT_FLOOR` below, which stays an absolute number.
#
# Still a ratchet, in the same direction: lower the rate whenever a batch is fixed, and never
# raise it to get green.
#
# Not every survivor is a defect. `ok "adopt runs" lx -y adopt` is an honest exit-code check
# whose EFFECT is asserted by the `test -s` on the next line, and that pair is correct. The
# ones worth fixing are the checks whose NAME claims an effect and which are followed by
# nothing that looks for it — `profile create scaffolds one` was one of those, and so was
# `module create`.

# There used to be one default — 86, the Windows harness's measured number — and the container
# harness's 92 lived only as `-e SURVIVOR_BUDGET=92` in `ci.yml`. So running this script the way
# the usage block above documents it failed on a clean tree, and the four-distro harness was
# mutation-tested in exactly one place while `harness-logic-test.sh` reported parity because the
# basename appeared in both release scripts.
#
# **The Windows harness is the clean demonstration of why this is a rate.** Between the last green
# CI run and today it grew from 131 checks to 139, its survivor COUNT went 85 to 90 — crossing a
# budget of 86 — and its survival RATE went 649 permille to 647. The count called that a
# regression. Nothing about it was one.
#
# Measured, do-nothing stub. "then" is CI run 31821612048, the last green main; "now" is CI
# nightly 31925296671, which a local `shall-it-ubuntu` reproduced to the check:
#
#             then                    now
#   container 91/157 = 580 permille   120/198 = 606 permille
#   windows   85/131 = 649            90/139  = 647
#
# **And three of the four cells got worse, which is stated rather than smoothed over.** Only the
# Windows do-nothing rate held. The container harness gained 41 checks and 29 of them survive a
# do-nothing binary against 12 that catch it, so the new batch is weaker than the harness it
# joined — precondition-heavy, for the reasons catalogued at the fail-stub numbers below. The
# ceilings here are therefore **a deliberate loosening**, set at today's measured rate plus room
# for the host wobble the old comments document. They are not evidence of an improvement and must
# not be quoted as one.
#
# That loosening is the price of replacing an instrument that could not measure the question at
# all. A count refuses a weak check and a strong one alike, so the cheapest way past it is to stop
# adding checks — and the four sections that arrived in those 41 are coverage this repository did
# not have. **That job was done rather than left as an aspiration**: the batch it named got its
# positive controls, the container do-nothing rate came back to 548 permille and the fail-stub
# rate to 51, and both ceilings below moved down with them. The numbers in the table above are
# kept as the "then" they were measured as, not rewritten to look better.
#
# Each rate is a ratchet from here: lower it when that batch is fixed, never raise it again.
# **Ratcheted 2026-08-16 (second round), measured not estimated.** The container harness
# moved from 120/198 = 606 permille to 107/195 = 548, and its caught count from 78 to 88,
# when the absence-after family got its positive controls. Both numbers move together, which
# is what a real strengthening looks like: a survivor became a catch rather than a check
# disappearing. The Windows row is untouched because nothing measured it this round.
#
# **Ratcheted again, on the container row only, for the presence direction (`stays_ok`).** The
# round above anchored claims that something went AWAY. The mirror image was still unanchored:
# `jq is still installed after unmanage` and `clean-cache frees archives without removing a
# package` were `ok`s whose whole content was a presence the machine may already have had, and
# **which one they were depended on the host** — a developer box that already had `jq` read
# PASS, a clean runner read FAIL, same stub, same harness. `stays_ok` demands a sighting that
# the package ARRIVED (the name resolving where it did not resolve before, G-3), so a survival
# proof can no longer be satisfied by the image.
#
# Measured on the container harness, host, `apt jq`:
#
#            then                 now
#   do-nothing   81/187 = 433     85/187 = 455    (survivors 106 -> 102, rate 566 -> 545)
#   fail-everyth 175 caught        177 caught      (survivors  11 ->   9, rate  59 ->  48)
#
# **The floor below is what makes the second row a strengthening rather than a subtraction**: the
# check count is identical at 187 in both, so a survivor that became a catch moved the rate
# rather than shrinking the harness.
#
# 600 -> 550 is the whole ratchet, and it is set above the number measured HERE rather than at
# it. This box is not a container: it runs eight checks fewer than a CI runner does (187 against
# 195), so a rate measured on it reads high for a reason that has nothing to do with the checks.
# 545 is what was measured and 550 is the ceiling; the CI rate should land near 528 on the same
# arithmetic, and 550 covers both without having to be re-measured on a runner to be believed.
#
# **Re-measured 2026-09-30, host, `apt jq`, after the section floor landed (`PLAN.md` #99):
# 101 of 188 survive a do-nothing binary (537 permille) and 8 of 187 survive a fail-everything
# one (42 permille, 179 caught).** One check was added and it is a CATCH under both stubs, which
# is the shape worth recording: a gate that asks how much of the harness RAN is itself a check
# that notices the product being absent, so both rates moved the right way and neither ceiling
# needed lowering. The `CAUGHT_FLOOR` of 80 is untouched for the same reason — it is a minimum,
# and 87 is above it.
#
# One caveat on reading a LOCAL number against a CI one, and it is about these two floors rather
# than about the checks: this host has no `/src/scripts/` at all, so `lifecycle-floor.txt` and
# `section-floor.txt` both take their "not in force, nothing was compared" branch and are counted
# as catches here **for that reason**. On the `ubuntu` leg both are mounted and both are judged on
# their numbers, so they are catches there too — same kind, different sentence, and the count is
# the same either way. What a local number cannot tell you is a class-specific floor: the local
# run has no `SHALL_IT_IMAGE`, so it is a host class of its own with no record in either file.
# The Windows row is untouched — nothing measured it, and a ratchet taken from another host
# class would be the count mistake this file exists to stop.

# A ceiling on survivors cannot tell "the checks got stronger" from "the checks were deleted".
# Proven rather than argued: pointed at a harness with three checks it reported `ok: 2
# survivors, within the budget of 92; 1 checks did their job` and exited 0. Deleting every
# effect assertion while still invoking every subcommand passed this gate, the lifecycle ratchet
# and the subcommand audit alike.
#
# Measured 2026-07-30 at 36 (Windows) and 44 (container); re-measured 2026-08-16 at 49 and 78,
# and the floors moved up with them — that is the direction this half ratchets. They stay a
# little under each, because this gate exists to catch a COLLAPSE — 35 down to 1 — and not a
# wobble of one or two checks between hosts. Ratchet them up when a batch of checks is
# strengthened; never down to get green, which is the same instruction the rate carries in the
# other direction.
#
# **This half stays an absolute count and must.** Once the survivor ceiling became a rate, the
# rate alone would be satisfied by deleting survivors and catches together in proportion — the
# three-check harness that reported `ok` still reports a fine rate. The floor is what says a
# harness this size exists at all.
FLOOR="${CAUGHT_FLOOR:-$DEFAULT_FLOOR}"
# The same pair for the fail-everything stub. Measured on this tree the day `refuses_with_3`
# split off from `nok`: Windows 12 survivors / 96 caught, container 17 / 118 (run outside a
# container, which reports one survivor fewer than CI does -- hence the single point of slack).
# The grader measured SEVENTEEN survivors on the Windows harness before the split, sixteen of
# them refusal checks. Five became assertions about exit 3 (`refuses_with_3`) and five more
# assert the sentence as well as the code (`nok_saying`), which took Windows 12 -> 7 and the
# container 17 -> 12 on the developer's box.
#
# **The numbers below are the RUNNER's, not that box's**, and the first version of this gate was
# red in CI for exactly that reason: the container harness leaves 12 survivors here and 14 on a
# clean ubuntu runner, because two checks that fail locally have nothing to act on there
# (`git log shows a shall commit`, `rebuild wrote no git commit`). A budget measured on one host
# and enforced on another is a gate that fails for being wrong about the machine rather than
# about the checks. The Windows harness goes the other way — 7 locally, 6 on the runner — so its
# budget is the tighter of the two.
#
# The survivors that remain are mostly ABSENCE assertions ("x is gone", "no commit was written"),
# and an absence cannot tell a product that did nothing right from one that did nothing at all.
# Lowering these rates means giving each a positive control, not deleting it. Ratchet down,
# never up.
#
# **Re-measured 2026-08-16 twice, and the second measurement is the one to read.** Against CI
# run 31821612048, the last green main, the container harness had gone 14/156 = 90 permille to
# 27/197 = 137 — the largest single loosening this file has ever carried, and the 27 were read
# one by one rather than summarised. Reading them is what produced the fix: **27 survivors of
# 197 became 10 of 194 — 51 permille — and the caught count went 170 to 184.**
#
# **The published 9/5/13 classification of those 27 was wrong**, and correcting it is most of
# what made them fixable. Seventeen of the 27 were controllable and are now controlled:
#
#   11 ABSENCE-AFTER assertions — "the shim is gone from disk", "the daemon really stopped",
#      "every file the tree placed is gone". Each now goes through the `witness` / `gone_ok`
#      pair in the harness: the sighting is recorded where the harness already asserts
#      presence, and an absence with no sighting behind it is a FAILURE, not a pass.
#    2 BOUNDS a zero satisfies — "adopt took no more than what apt calls user-chosen". A bound
#      over an empty set is not a weak assertion, it is no assertion, so it now reports
#      unmeasured rather than passing.
#    3 REFUSAL checks that scored any non-zero exit. `nok_saying` with the SUBJECT as the
#      pattern: the stub never echoes its arguments and every real refusal names what it
#      refused, so this is both the tighter check and the one a user needs (V.42).
#    1 PATTERN that matched the program's own name. `protected includes a system essential`
#      grepped for `shall\|libc\|systemd\|...`, and the stub prints `shall: this stub fails
#      everything`. The alternation no longer contains `shall`.
#
# **And one of the 27 had a published explanation that was tested and pronounced false.**
# `running the shim reaches the real tool` invokes `"$_bindir/$PKG" --version` and greps for
# the package name — so a shell asked to run a file that is not there prints the path in its
# own error and `bash: /root/.local/bin/jq: No such file or directory` matches `[jJ]q`. That
# hypothesis was recorded as disproved because the experiment used an EMPTY path, where the
# error names `/` and no longer contains the pattern. Right hypothesis, different command. It
# is guarded on the shim existing now.
#
# **The 8 that remain are three shapes a fail-everything stub cannot distinguish. None of them
# is a weak check and none of them is a job.** This list is re-measured, not inherited: the
# round above wrote down 10 and named them, and the `stays_ok` batch took 3 of the 11 that were
# actually there. **One of the three it took was not in the list at all** — `$PKG is reinstalled,
# not left removed` had been surviving for as long as the checks above it and no one had written
# it down, which is the argument for reading the run's own survivor list rather than the last
# summary of it.
#
#    5 PRECONDITIONS — "no shim exists before the sync that deploys it", "nothing is adopted
#      before adopt runs", "the link target does not exist before sync", "the dir target does
#      not exist before sync", "the tree's destinations are empty before sync". These run
#      BEFORE the product acts, so no product behaviour can move them. They are the controls
#      the checks after them depend on; deleting them to lower this number would weaken the
#      harness while improving its score.
#    2 assertions that the product showed RESTRAINT — "and freezes nothing", "and the
#      unapproved script did NOT run". There is no earlier presence to witness, because the
#      whole claim is that nothing was ever written. A stub that does nothing has exactly the
#      same restraint, and no instrument of this shape can tell the two apart.
#    1 INSTRUMENT ARTEFACT — "git log shows a shall commit" greps for `shall:`, and the fail
#      stub writes `shall: this stub fails everything` to stderr, which `grep_ok` folds into
#      its output. The check is not weak; the stub's prefix collides with the product's
#      commit-subject prefix. Changing either to break the collision would make the stub or the
#      product less like itself, which is a worse trade than one known survivor.
#
# **What went, and the reason is the same one each time: the check asserted a presence the
# machine may have owned before the run.** `python3 still installed after adopt` is now gated on
# adopt having taken a row of this manager at all, which is this file's own "a bound over an
# empty set is not an assertion" rule applied to the case that rule had not been applied to. The
# other two were converted to `stays_ok`. Neither a presence the product never wrote nor one a
# command that could have removed it left should ever have been scored without a record of the
# arrival behind it.
#
# So the ceiling below is a MEASUREMENT with a few points of runner slack, not a loosening.
# Still a ratchet in the same direction: lower it when a batch is fixed, never raise it to get
# green. The Windows row is unchanged — the same `witness`/`gone_ok` pair landed in that
# harness for its two absence-after checks, and nothing measured the result this round.
#
# **The fail-stub row was ratcheted with the `stays_ok` batch: 70 -> 60, for the same
# measurement and the same reason.** Host `apt jq`: 11 survivors of 186 (59 permille) became 9
# of 186 (48). Two of the three that went are the presence-direction pair, and they went for the
# sharper reason — against a shall that installs nothing there is no arrival to witness, so
# `stays_ok` now `hard`s by name instead of reading "(was there, still there)" over a binary the
# image owned. 60 is set above the 48 measured here for the same host-class reason as the row
# above, and the 9 that remain are the documented irreducible set: five preconditions, three
# RESTRAINT claims, and the one instrument artefact whose stub prefix collides with the
# product's own commit subject.
#
# `FAIL_CAUGHT_FLOOR` is deliberately NOT ratcheted, and the reason is worth recording. It reads
# 178 and this host measures 177 — and it measured 175 before this batch, so the shortfall is
# pre-existing and is the host/runner gap the paragraph above describes, not a regression here.
# Lowering a floor because the machine you are standing on is not the machine the number was
# measured on is the exact move the "never down to get green" line forbids. It will read green
# on a runner; what it reads here is a stated fact about this box.
