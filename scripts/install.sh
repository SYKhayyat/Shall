# The build target this machine wants, empty when no release binary is published for it.
# `uname -m` on arm64 macOS says `arm64`; the Rust triple says `aarch64`.
#
# **x86_64 Linux takes the static musl build, on every distribution.** Not a detection — the
# absence of one, deliberately.
#
# A `-gnu` binary is dynamically linked against a loader that Alpine does not have and that NixOS
# replaces with a stub whose only job is to refuse. The first version of this sniffed for
# `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and chose `gnu` when it was there, which is **wrong on the very
# platform it was written for**: NixOS ships that path as a symlink to `stub-ld`, so the test
# passes and the binary then dies with
#
#     Could not start dynamically linked executable: …
#     NixOS cannot run dynamically linked executables intended for generic linux environments
#
# Measured on NixOS 26.05 under WSL, after the same check had been "verified" against
# `nixos/nix` — which is the Nix package manager on a minimal base and not NixOS at all.
#
# A detector has to be right about every distribution's quirks and is wrong the first time one of
# them is unusual. A statically linked binary has no interpreter to miss, so there is nothing to
# be right about: the same artifact was measured reporting `shall 0.8.0` on ubuntu:24.04,
# alpine:3.20, nixos/nix AND real NixOS. One binary, every Linux.
#
# **Both architectures take musl now.** The comment here used to say `-gnu` "is still what
# arm64 gets, since no aarch64 musl row exists yet", which left an arm64 Alpine or NixOS box
# — a Pi, a Graviton instance, an arm64 container — compiling 448 crates under fat LTO on
# hardware chosen for its power draw. `ci.yml` builds `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` through
# `cargo-zigbuild`, so the same one-artifact-every-Linux argument now holds on arm64 too.
# `-gnu` is still published for both architectures for anyone who wants it.

# twice — two machines installed an hour apart got different programs and neither could say
# which. The default is the newest release TAG, and `SHALL_REF` overrides it:
#
#   SHALL_REF=main   ...install.sh | sh     # follow the branch, deliberately
#   SHALL_REF=v0.8.0 ...install.sh | sh     # a specific release
#
# A repo with no tags yet falls back to the branch and SAYS SO, rather than silently
# installing something else than it promised.
# **A branch is not a tag, and cargo is told which.** `SHALL_REF` is documented above as "tag or
# branch" and both examples were passed to `--tag`, so the branch example — the one written in
# this file — could not work: `cargo install --git X --tag main` asks libgit2 for
# `refs/remotes/origin/tags/main` and is told `NotFound`. The nightly job runs the documented
# line with `SHALL_REF=main` and has never once been green.
#
