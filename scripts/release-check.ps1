# release-check.ps1 - the single "am I ready to ship?" gate for Windows.
#
# Runs the hermetic gates then the native Windows integration sweep and prints one go/no-go:
#   1. cargo clippy -D warnings   (HARD)
#      cargo test --release --no-fail-fast   (HARD)
#      cargo build --release       (HARD)
#      cargo fmt -- --check        (HARD - CI fails the build on it, so this must too)
#   2. scripts/integration-windows.sh - real install/list/remove for every backend installable
#      on this host (scoop + any bootstrapped ecosystem managers + winget/choco if present),
#      full feature coverage, and the self-checking coverage audit.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, in PowerShell):
#   ./scripts/release-check.ps1
#   ./scripts/release-check.ps1 -Backend scoop -Package jq        # choose the primary backend
#   ./scripts/release-check.ps1 -SkipIntegration                  # hermetic gates only
#
# The integration step needs Git-Bash (bash), which ships with Git for Windows. Run elevated to
# exercise choco/winget mutation; scoop alone needs no admin.
#
# NOTE: a bare `bash` on PATH is often scoop's *busybox* shim, whose bash cannot run this POSIX
# script (it fails with "Could not create process"). We therefore locate the real Git-for-Windows
# bash explicitly and only fall back to a PATH `bash` that is NOT busybox.
