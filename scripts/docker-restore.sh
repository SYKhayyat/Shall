# **Why this exists.** CI is the gate and it is comprehensive - every push builds and tests on
# three platforms and runs seven integration images; the nightly adds tools, gentoo, guix,
# slackware, macOS, Windows and thirteen `cargo mutants` shards. What CI cannot do is answer
# WHY. When
# a nightly goes red, the container is how you find out: it settled the 2026-08-21 cabal root
# cause in four minutes when reasoning could not, and it proved a one-line harness fix in ninety
# seconds against a forty-minute nightly on a broken `main`.
#
# So the images are cache, not capability: they cost ~135 GB and rebuild from these Dockerfiles
# on demand, and this script is the way back. **Cache, not free** - see the timing below before
# emptying anything. Reclaiming space is usually not a choice between keeping the images and
# losing them: `docker builder prune` took 93 GB of build cache down to its 7 GB working set on
# this machine without touching a single image, which is most of what "Docker is full" means.
#
# **It does not contain a build.** `docker/integration/run.sh BUILD_ONLY=1` is the one place that
# knows `-f Dockerfile.$d -t shall-it-$d .`, and a second copy here would be exactly the
# two-of-everything this repository keeps paying for.

# that as a daemon problem sends the reader to fix the wrong thing. `unix-check.sh` already
# falls back to `wsl -- docker`; this goes one further and re-execs the whole script inside the
# distro, because `run.sh` below calls `docker build` directly and would otherwise need the

# floor is ~35 minutes per image whatever the distro, and `tools` adds its own OCaml, Haskell,
# Nim and HPC builds on top of that. Eleven images is most of a working day.
