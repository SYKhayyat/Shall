# Shall v7 native Windows/macOS sweep — host-native backends (scoop/winget/
# choco/brew) driven through the real `shall` binary. These OSes can't run in a
# Linux container, so this mirrors the container harness (run-in-container.sh)
# for the host, section for section — including its COVERAGE AUDIT.
#
#   scripts/integration-windows.sh [backend] [package]
#   e.g. scripts/integration-windows.sh scoop jq        # user-scoped, reversible
#        SHALL=./target/release/shall.exe scripts/integration-windows.sh
#
# scoop is the safe default (user-scoped, trivially reversible). Shall's own
# state is isolated via SHALL_CONFIG_DIR / SHALL_DATA_DIR; real package installs
# do affect the host, so prefer scoop and a throwaway package.
#
# THIS RUNS ON A REAL MACHINE, not a disposable container. So the real-lifecycle
# sweep is limited to managers that install per-user and uninstall cleanly; the
# machine-wide ones (winget, choco, psresource) are plan-smoked and NAMED as
# such, because proving a parser is not worth writing to a developer's Program
# Files. Every one of them still gets its argv/planner wiring exercised.
#
# HARD exit-code assertions (ok/nok/grep_ok); the run exits non-zero on any hard
# failure.

# CI, so the last lines of a failure are stack frames — on macOS, a column of identical

# that says what went wrong scrolls off the top. A frame is never the reason a check
# failed, so the backtrace is dropped and what remains is the message.

# **It takes the log as an argument, and that is the point** (2026-07-29). It used to read

# `tail` with no filtering — including `classify_install`'s retry, which is the one that reports
# a confirmed defect. A real macOS run produced exactly the failure this comment describes:

# Why an install failed — a question, not an assumption (E5).
#
# Both harnesses used to soften ANY install failure into a claim about the network, and skip
# that backend's whole remaining lifecycle. In one observed run it fired four times and not
# once was it the network: one was Shall correctly refusing, two were real argv defects
# (`helm`, `luarocks`). Coverage disappeared exactly where the product was broken, and the run
# still reported success.
#
# Sets CLASS to one of:
#   refused    Shall declined on purpose (exit 3, U21). Its own outcome, not a failure.
#   timeout    the build ran out of time (124). Not a verdict on the backend.
#   transient  failed once, succeeded on retry. The caller CONTINUES the lifecycle — skipping
#              it is how list, PATH, remove and gone-from-list went unrun for every backend
#              whose install was flaky.
#   exhausted  Shall classed the failure passing and it did not pass in this window — a rate
#              limit with 20 minutes left on it. SOFT, and recorded as a lifecycle this run
#              could not measure, which is not the same fact as a lifecycle that got worse.
#   defect     failed permanently, or failed twice with nothing classifying it. Hard.
#
#
# TRANSIENCE IS READ, NOT RE-DERIVED (R-3). It is a claim that a second attempt could differ,
# and Shall already answers it — `Retryability`, from the backend's own exit policy. Until
# 2026-07-30 nothing downstream could see that answer, so this function re-derived it by
# RETRYING THE INSTALL IMMEDIATELY. That proxy is wrong for exactly the failures the
# classification gets right: a GitHub rate limit with 1236 seconds left on the window cannot
# succeed one second later, so it scored `defect`, the macOS leg went red, and the
# real-lifecycle ratchet fell 8 -> 7 and went red behind it. Two red jobs over an answer the
# program had already computed.
#
# So `shall-failure-class:` is read, and the retry is kept only where it still adds evidence:
#
#   permanent  -> a defect now. Retrying a 404 to confirm it is still a 404 costs a minute and
#                 tells nobody anything.
#   transient  -> retry ONCE, because "a second attempt could differ" is worth testing where
#                 testing it is cheap. A repeat is NOT a defect: it is exhausted, which is what
#                 `Retryability::Exhausted` means — the claim was tested and did not hold, and
#                 "this can never work" is more than was measured.
#   unknown    -> retry once and treat a repeat as a defect. Nothing classified it, so here the
#                 retry IS the evidence.
#
# A missing class line is a defect too: every failing command emits one, so its absence means
# the binary under test is not the tree that was built.
# $5 runs between the two attempts, for a caller that must clear a declaration the failed
# attempt left behind. Pass `:` when there is nothing to undo.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An excuse that has to be written down.
#
# `classify_install` above degrades an ecosystem failure to `exhausted` - soft, and recorded
# in `be-life-unmeasured` so the real-lifecycle ratchet counts it as measurABLE rather than
# as coverage lost. That is right for the case it was built for, a rate-limit window with
# twenty minutes left on it. It is wrong for the case that turned up on 2026-08-21: Hackage
# rotated its TUF root past what Ubuntu's cabal-install trusts, which is not a window that
# moves on its own and which no later run clears until somebody changes the image.
#
# An excuse nobody can see is `|| true` with better manners. So a backend is excused only
# while a dated line in `lifecycle-floor.txt` says so:
#
#     drift <host-class> <backend> <YYYY-MM-DD>   # what broke, in the tool's own words
#
# An unregistered backend does not count toward the floor, so the ratchet fails on the
# shortfall and names it, and the run prints the line to add with today's date. That is the
# whole gate: a human sees it once, and writes down what they decided.
#
# **The line does not expire, and the age is printed instead.** It did expire, at fourteen
# days, on the reasoning that an excuse nothing ages rots. The owner ruled it out on
# 2026-08-21 for a repository that is not attended daily: an expiry turns one upstream
# rotation into a board that goes red and STAYS red, and a permanently red board is one
# nobody reads - which is the failure this whole mechanism exists to prevent, arriving by
# the other road. So every run says how long each excuse has stood. Nobody has to act;
# nobody can say they were not told.
#
# In `lifecycle-floor.txt` and not a file of its own, deliberately: `scripts/` is excluded
# from the build context, so every gate that lives there reaches a container only by being
# mounted, and a gate that is not mounted is a gate not in force - which this repository has
# already paid for once, with the ratchet absent from five legs and every one of them green.

# Days since 1970-01-01 for a YYYY-MM-DD, by arithmetic and not by `date -d`.
#
# This runs in a container (GNU date), on git-bash (GNU date) and on a macOS runner (BSD date),
# and `-d` means a different thing on the third. Arithmetic means the same thing on all three.
#
# NO LINE IN THIS FUNCTION OR THE NEXT MAY END IN `}`. `harness-logic-test.sh` lifts them out of
# both harnesses by name so the twins cannot drift, and its extractor stops at the first line
# that closes a brace — a truncated lift is a syntax error blamed on the harness rather than on
# the extractor. Hence `"${1#*-}"` quoted, and `if`/`fi` where a `{ …; }` guard would read
# better.

# lifecycle (ceiling 15) — cabal composer conda flatpak macports mix nix opam pkg pkg_add pkgin

# under them, which is exactly where "it works on Linux" stops being evidence.
#
# Three things this platform cannot do, each MEASURED here rather than assumed:
#   * no group kill — `setsid` does not exist on Windows, so the package manager cannot be
#     taken down with Shall and the hostile third iteration the container runs is absent.
#   * no `sudo` section — `run_on` inserts `sudo` only when `!cfg!(windows)`, so there is no
#     privileged path on this platform to drive. Its absence is correct, not a gap.
#   * the canaries are scoop's, because scoop is user-scoped and reversible; a machine-wide
#     manager is not something to crash halfway through on somebody's real computer.

# an unfinished job into a permanent disclaimer. So a backend with no real lifecycle in an
# automated gate is a **release blocker**, and its item 4 is *no new backend is added until the
# current set passes*.

# could answer "which registered backends have no path to a real lifecycle at all". The
# per-run audit above cannot: it asks *lifecycle OR plan-smoke*, and a plan-smoke satisfies it.
